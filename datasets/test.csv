945,1165,"""High exposure to radio frequency radiation associated with cancer in male ratsNTP releases final reports on rat and mouse studies of radio frequency radiation like that used in 2G and 3G cell phone technologiesThe National Toxicology Program NTP concluded there is clear evidence that male rats exposed to high levels of radio frequency radiation RFR like that used in 2G and 3G cell phones developed cancerous heart tumors according to final reports released today There was also some evidence of tumors in the brain and adrenal gland of exposed male rats For female rats and male and female mice the evidence was equivocal as to whether cancers observed were associated with exposure to RFR The final reports represent the consensus of NTP and a panel of external scientific experts who reviewed the studies in March after draft reports were issued in FebruaryThe exposures used in the studies cannot be compared directly to the exposure that humans experience when using a cell phone said John Bucher PhD NTP senior scientist In our studies rats and mice received radio frequency radiation across their whole bodies By contrast people are mostly exposed in specific local tissues close to where they hold the phone In addition the exposure levels and durations in our studies were greater than what people experienceThe lowest exposure level used in the studies was equal to the maximum local tissue exposure currently allowed for cell phone users This power level rarely occurs with typical cell phone use The highest exposure level in the studies was four times higher than the maximum power level permittedWe believe that the link between radio frequency radiation and tumors in male rats is real and the external experts agreed said BucherThe 30 million NTP studies took more than 10 years to complete and are the most comprehensive assessment to date of health effects in animals exposed to RFR with modulations used in 2G and 3G cell phones 2G and 3G networks were standard when the studies were designed and are still used for phone calls and textingA major strength of our studies is that we were able to control exactly how much radio frequency radiation the animals received  something thats not possible when studying human cell phone use which has often relied on questionnaires said Michael Wyde PhD lead toxicologist on the studiesHe also noted the unexpected finding of longer lifespans among the exposed male rats This may be explained by an observed decrease in chronic kidney problems that are often the cause of death in older rats Wyde saidThe animals were housed in chambers specifically designed and built for these studies Exposure to RFR began in the womb for rats and at 5 to 6 weeks old for mice and continued for up to two years or most of their natural lifetime The RFR exposure was intermittent 10 minutes on and 10 minutes off totaling about nine hours each day RFR levels ranged from 156 watts per kilogram in rats and 2510 watts per kilogram in miceThese studies did not investigate the types of RFR used for WiFi or 5G networks5G is an emerging technology that hasnt really been defined yet From what we currently understand it likely differs dramatically from what we studied said WydeFor future studies NTP is building smaller RFR exposure chambers that will make it easier to evaluate newer telecommunications technologies in weeks or months rather than years These studies will focus on developing measurable physical indicators or biomarkers of potential effects from RFR These may include changes in metrics like DNA damage in exposed tissues which can be detected much sooner than cancerThe US Food and Drug Administration nominated cell phone RFR for study by NTP because of widespread public use of cell phones and limited knowledge about potential health effects from longterm exposure NTP will provide the results of these studies to FDA and the Federal Communications Commission who will review the information

Elizabeths outstanding arrest warrantThe order to arrest Queen Elizabeth was issued in 2013 by six judges of the International Common Law Court of Justice in BrusselsAfter nearly a year of litigation Queen Elizabeth and her husband Prince Phillip were found guilty in the disappearance of ten native children from the Catholicrun Kamloops residential school in British Columbia Grieving parents havent seen their children since they left for a picnic with the Royal couple on Oct 10 1964On May 10th the International Tribunal into Crimes of Church and State was asking concerned citizens to demand Cunninghams immediate release The ITCCS successfully prosecuted Queen Elizabeths kidnapping along with 50000 cases of other missing childrenRegiment soldier Cunningham had innocently questioned a senior officer about Queen Elizabeths arrest warrant only to be committed to a mental care unit in Stafford EnglandHe was injected with an atypical antipsychotic drug olanzapine under orders of Captain Murrell and Doctors Khan and Sema The soldier was committed for six months to the St George Hospital Psychiatric Unit with a diagnosis of suffering from an acute psychotic episodeQueen Elizabeth had direct involvement in the kidnapping and death of aboriginal children it was reported on the ITCCS website Royal Family members also appeared to regularly participate in Ninth Circle Satanic Cult rituals at the Mohawk Indian School in Brantford Ontario CanadaIn April a second international trial began in Brussels on global elite members of the Ninth Circle Satanic CultA court document had been filed indicating that in Jan 2012 UK Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby acted under the direction of Queen Elizabeth to destroy forensic remains of a Ninth Circle Satanic Cult child homicide Two eyewitnesses have testified that as children they were present during this same murder of a native childThe satanic rite evidently occurred in a sub basement catacomb under the west wing of the Canadian Branton Ontario Mohawk Indian residential school The two eyewitnesses alleged that they saw a young girl being bound to an altarThe five or six yearold child was gagged repeatedly raped killed disemboweled and dismembered Her blood was consumed by nine redrobed figures that included a member of the British Royal FamilyUnfortunately Cunningham was not alone in his victimization

1323,511,"""Jan 19 2023  An emerging trend in virtual reality  incorporating smell  could be exciting news not just for gaming but for health care as well A growing number of hospitals across the country are using virtual reality to help patients manage pain overcome phobias and calm anxiety Providers and patients report mostly good results save for the high price tag And VR therapies may start to become more common particularly if insurers begin to cover the cost But despite its potential in health care VR continues to fall short in one way We still cant smell it Smell hasnt been explored enough in virtual reality but it deserves to be says Judith Amores PhD senior researcher at Microsoft Research and research affiliate at the MIT Media Lab The potential benefits are incredible Amores has researched connecting VR with smell to enhance a persons response In one experiment she had participants wear a VR headset that depicted calming nature scenes and a smart necklace she developed capable of releasing lavender scent When bursts of lavender were added to the VR the participants reported feeling 26 more relaxed than they had without the scent A device that monitors brain activity confirmed it The participants physiological response had increased by 25 when scent was added The study was small just 12 people but Amores says it represents a direction that demands to be explored with more people in peerreviewed research A 2022 systematic review of research on virtual reality using multiple senses backs her up Smell and taste are still underexplored the review says and they can bring significant value to VR applications  including health When we smell something receptor cells in the nose message the olfactory bulb at the base of the brain That information is shuttled to the amygdala and hippocampus brain areas responsible for processing memory and emotion Amores explains Your sense of smell goes directly into the emotional center of the brain says Amores That means you can literally change how you feel based on what youre smelling Thus smell has the power to immerse us deeper into virtual reality which could make VR treatments faster and more effective Amores saysWhile medical research in this area may be slow the entertainment industrys efforts could help push it forward No VR systems that incorporate smell are available yet Amores says but that may change as soon as this year At the international Consumer Electronics Show CES held earlier this month Vermontbased OVR Technology unveiled a headset with eight primary aromas that can be combined to create thousands of scents The ION3 as its called is scheduled to be released later this year Meanwhile a study published in the International Journal of HumanComputer Studies describes an odor machine that was tested with a virtual reality headset from tech giant HTC The researchers suggest such technology could among other uses help enhance smell training for those whove lost their sense of smell due to COVID19 Smellenhanced VR therapies could be explored for all kinds of clinical uses Amores says like to treat anxiety sleep disorders or even Alzheimers disease smell is linked to memory VR exposure therapy has already been used to treat PTSD in military veterans immersing them into a virtual environment that triggers a traumatic memory desensitizing them to the memory so they learn their thoughts are safe A 2021 article in Brain Research noted that incorporating smell into such therapy is critically needed since odors can trigger traumatic memories in some cases more fiercely than sounds A distressing scent like diesel fuel or the smell of something burning could be followed by or layered with a relaxing scent such as pine eucalyptus or cinnamon in a gradual way to reduce or even eliminate smell triggers according to the paper Those with addictions may benefit from VR exposure therapy too learning to manage or resist cravings triggered by certain cues some research suggests VR has the power to transport them anywhere  to a bar or a party say  and the scent of wine or cigarettes may add to the realism needed to elicit cravings Another application could be surgery prep Amores says A patient has a VR session complete with relaxing smells  walking through a forest and breathing in the scents of pine and moss for example  lowering anxiety before the procedure and potentially reducing the amount of pain medication needed and improving outcomesThose smells could be deployed again during hospitalization or recovery  with or without the VR  to quickly return the patient to a calm state Its a kind of Pavlovian conditioning that would be easy to replicate says Amores At CedarsSinai in Los Angeles VR is being researched and used to help patients alleviate pain across a variety of conditions including irritable bowel syndrome and chronic lower back pain Melissa Wong MD an OBGYN specializing in maternalfetal medicine at CedarsSinai has studied VR for pain and stress relief during labor and childbirth possibly delaying the use of an epidural There is absolutely something about the mindbody connection when it comes to pain says Wong and the use of VR could tap into that Making it more immersive by adding scent would likely amplify those effects she adds As research continues to highlight the power of smell well likely see the sense being implemented more and more in clinical treatment Amores predicts It may not be long before SmelloVision comes to a hospital near you""",WebMD,real,0,1323

733,667,"""Largescale study of US teens shows associations between outdoor artificial light at night and health outcomesResearch shows that adolescents who live in areas that have high levels of artificial light at night tend to get less sleep and are more likely to have a mood disorder relative to teens who live in areas with low levels of nighttime light The research was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health NIMH part of the National Institutes of Health and is published in JAMA PsychiatryThese findings illustrate the importance of joint consideration of both broader environmentallevel and individuallevel exposures in mental health and sleep research says study author Diana Paksarian PhD a postdoctoral research fellow at NIMHDaily rhythms including the circadian rhythms that drive our sleepwake cycles are thought to be important factors that contribute to physical and mental health The presence of artificial light at night can disrupt these rhythms altering the lightdark cycle that influences hormonal cellular and other biological processes Researchers have investigated associations among indoor artificial light daily rhythms and mental health but the impact of outdoor artificial light has received relatively little attention especially in teensIn this study Paksarian Kathleen Merikangas PhD senior investigator and chief of the Genetic Epidemiology Research Branch at NIMH and coauthors examined data from a nationally representative sample of adolescents in the United States which was collected from 2001 to 2004 as part of the National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement NCSA The dataset included information about individuallevel and neighborhoodlevel characteristics mental health outcomes and sleep patterns for a total of 10123 teens ages 13 to 18 years oldAs part of inperson interviews for the NCSA the adolescents completed a validated assessment to determine whether they met the diagnostic criteria for various mental disorders The teens also answered questions about their sleep habits reporting what time they usually went to bed and how many hours of sleep they usually got on weeknights and on weekendsTo gauge the teens exposure to outdoor artificial light at night the researchers used satellite imagery data to calculate the average artificial light levels for each census block group in the US As expected levels of artificial light at night varied according to certain neighborhoodlevel factors such as urbanicity socioeconomic levels and population densityImportantly teens who lived in areas with high levels of artificial light at night tended to report later weeknight bedtimes and shorter weeknight sleep duration This association held even after the researchers accounted for various individuallevel factors such as age sex raceethnicity number of siblings parental education and neighborhoodlevel factors such as countylevel urbanicity and population density The analyses showed that on average teens in areas with the highest levels of outdoor light went to bed about 29 minutes later and got 11 fewer minutes of sleep than did teens in areas with the lowest levelsThe data showed that greater levels of artificial light at night were also associated with increased likelihood of having a mood disorder or anxiety disorder Specifically teens who lived in areas with higher levels of artificial light at night were more likely to meet the diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder or specific phobiaAccording to Paksarian and coauthors this association is noteworthy because disruptions to sleep and circadian rhythms is a welldocumented feature of certain mental disorders including bipolar disorder The study findings point to disrupted sleep as a possible link between artificial nighttime light exposure and mental health outcomes a link that should be tested in future prospective researchThe study findings also highlight social disparities in exposure to artificial light indicating that teens who belong to racialethnic minority groups who come from immigrant families or who come from families with lower income are more likely to live in areas with high levels of outdoor light at night To the extent that exposure to artificial light disrupts daily rhythms such as sleep patterns it could serve as an added stressor for teens who are already at increased risk for health problems due to social disadvantageFuture experimental studies that examine the effects of different properties of artificial light  such as brightness and spectral composition  could help researchers determine whether lightingfocused interventions are likely to benefit adolescent sleep and mental healthAlthough environmental light exposure is only one factor in a more complex network of influences on sleep and behavior it is likely to be an important target for prevention and interventions in adolescent health says MerikangasAbout the National Institute of Mental Health NIMH The

useLaw enforcement seizures of pills containing illicit fentanyl increased dramatically between January 2018 and December 2021 according to a new study The number of individual pills seized by law enforcement increased nearly 50fold from the first quarter of 2018 to the last quarter of 2021 and the proportion of pills to total seizures more than doubled with pills representing over a quarter of illicit fentanyl seizures by the end of 2021 The study also found an increase in the number of fentanylcontaining powder seizures during this timeThis study was published today in Drug and Alcohol Dependence and funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse NIDA part of the National Institutes of Health According to the most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data the United States hit a record high in the number of overdose deaths ever recorded estimating that nearly 106000 people died from drug overdoses in the 12month period ending in October 2021 This rise is largely driven by illicit fentanyl and other synthetic opioidsIllicit fentanyl is highly potent cheaply made and easily transported making it a profitable narcotic While people may seek out illicit fentanyl intentionally many people are not aware that the drug they are using  including heroin cocaine methamphetamine or benzodiazepines  may actually be fentanyl or has been adulterated or contaminated with fentanyl Because fentanyl is about 50 times more potent than heroin and a lethal dose may be as small as two milligrams using a drug that has been laced with fentanyl can greatly increase overdose riskAn increase in illicit pills containing fentanyl points to a new and increasingly dangerous period in the United States said NIDA Director Nora D Volkow MD Pills are often taken or snorted by people who are more nave to drug use and who have lower tolerances When a pill is contaminated with fentanyl as is now often the case poisoning can easily occurIllicitly manufactured powder fentanyl has been a known adulterant in drugs since 2013 but the extent that fentanyl is found in counterfeit pills has been largely unknown To address this question a team led by Joseph J Palamar PhD MPH associate professor at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine and coinvestigator on the NIDAfunded National Drug Early Warning System NDEWS analyzed data on drug seizures by law enforcement The data were collected between January of 2018 and December of 2021 from the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas HIDTA program a grant program aimed at reducing drug trafficking and misuse administered by the Office of National Drug Control Policy in which the Drug Enforcement Administration and the CDC play an active roleComparing data from the first quarter of 2018 with the last quarter of 2021 the team found that the number of seizures of pills containing fentanyl increased from 68 to 635 and the total number of individual pills seized by law enforcement increased from 42202 to 2089186 Seizures of powder containing fentanyl also increased from 424 to 1539 and the total weight of powder seized increased from 2982 kg to 24160 kgUnlike most survey data and surveillance systems which can be lagged for a year or more HIDTA data are made available quarterly allowing evaluation in almost real time HIDTA also distinguish between the presence of fentanyl in pill or powder form Analyzing these data can therefore help identify trends in availability of illicit substances and act as a type of early warning system to shift public health education or interventional resources more quicklyHIDTA data does not differentiate between fentanyl and its analogs nor estimate the amount of fentanyl present in seized substances however given the small amount necessary for an overdose the authors note that the presence of any fentanyl is an important indicator of overdose risk People who purchase counterfeit drugs such as illicit oxycodone hydrocodone or benzodiazepines may be at risk for unintentional exposure to fentanyl which is associated with increased risk of overdose death Further people who use these types of pills are less likely to have a tolerance built to opioids and when coupled with the sedative effects of nonfentanyl opioids or benzodiazepines may further increase risk of overdose and deathFor the first time we can see this rapid rise in pills adulterated with fentanyl which raises red flags for increasing risk of harm in a population that is possibly less experienced with opioids said Dr Palamar We absolutely need more harm reduction strategies such as naloxone distribution and fentanyl test strips as well as widespread education about the risk of pills that are not coming from a pharmacy The immediate message here is that pills illegally obtained can contain fentanylThe researchers emphasize that drug seizure rates are not direct measures of actual drug availability However the increase in fentanylrelated drug seizures coincides with increasing synthetic opioidrelated overdose death rates These data also corroborate data from the DEA National Forensic Laboratory Information System showing a steady increase in fentanyl seizures in recent years even across the earlier parts of the COVID19 pandemic For additional NDEWS research and reports visit httpsndewsorgTo address the overdose crisis you need realtime highquality drug surveillance

2241,881,"""The incidence of reported cases of tickborne diseases in the United States has significantly increased in recent years It is expected to continue to grow as tick species expand their geographical reach and new ticktransmitted pathogens emerge raising the potential for serious human illness and death A new strategic research plan from the National Institutes of Health aims to build on  and accelerate  new and existing research initiatives to improve scientific understanding of ticks and the pathogens they may transmit and to develop the necessary tools and strategies to better diagnose prevent and treat tickborne diseasesAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 59349 cases of tickborne disease were reported in 2017 compared to 48610 cases in 2016 Lyme disease accounted for the bulk 82 of the cases Recent CDC estimates suggest that Lyme disease is underreported and that the true incidence is likely 10 times higher At least 20 different diseasecausing bacteria viruses and parasites are known to be transmitted from ticks to people Depending on the disease patients can experience symptoms that range from mild infections that resolve on their own to serious illness extended disability or deathMany tickborne diseases have been discovered only recently For example in 2009 scientists reported a redmeat allergy known as alpha gal syndrome Growing evidence suggests that this reaction may be associated with the bite of a tick but further research is needed to understand this connection Newly identified ticktransmitted pathogens continue to be reported raising concerns about missed diagnoses inadequate treatment and knowledge gaps related to tickborne diseasesThe new NIH Strategic Plan for Tickborne Disease Research focuses on five scientific priorities for advancing research and development over the next five years First the plan calls for improving fundamental knowledge of tickborne diseases including the biology of tickborne pathogens how they are transmitted to humans evade the immune system and spread within the body This area also includes determining the cause of persistent symptoms in some people infected with tickborne diseases such as Lyme disease and furthering the understanding of how tickderived factors contribute to the establishment and severity of diseaseSecond the plan calls for improving detection and diagnosis of tickborne diseases by developing rapid diagnostic tests that can detect a pathogen both early and late in infection and distinguish between active and past infections Third NIH will support the development of diagnostics capable of predicting treatment success and identifying human biomarkers of infection and persistent symptomsThe new plan also prioritizes the acceleration of research designed to prevent tickborne disease infection including vaccines and immunebased treatments as well as strategies to reduce the transmission of tickborne pathogens to animal populations that serve as hostsFourth the plan focuses on research to develop new treatments for tickborne diseases and techniques to reduce disease complications Fifth the plan prioritizes the development of tools and resources to advance tickborne disease research by improving scientists access to biological samples tickborne disease genetic data and supporting preclinical development of promising productsNIH intends to expand collaborations across its institutes and centers to promote a multidisciplinary approach to tickborne disease research answer complex biological questions and encourage the application of stateoftheart technologies used successfully in a range of scientific disciplinesThe new NIH strategic plan builds on the activities of the Department of Health and Human Services TickBorne Diseases Working Group which issued a 2018 report to Congress outlining research recommendations NIH sought input from the research and medical communities patient advocacy groups

the best part I remember waking up and feeling more alive than I ever had Uccellini says I wasnt feeling tired anymore Uccellini had finally gotten a kidney transplant after being on dialysis since she was 6 At birth she says her right kidney had never fully formed and the other kidney was not functioning properly either A transplant was the solution This year as always Uccellini celebrated her transplant anniversary Aug 7 She was joined by her husband two children and other family members We were in Cape Charles VA on vacation she says The family shared a feast of crab legs shrimp crab cakes other seafood and corn on the cob As Uccellini and her family celebrated her milestone the organ transplant community was nearing one of its own And on Friday it happened One million organ transplants have been performed in the United States according to the United Network for Organ Sharing UNOS the private nonprofit organization that manages the US organ transplantation system under contract with the federal government Since the first transplant a kidney was performed in Boston in 1954 the numbers of procedures have steadily grown with 2021 the banner year We passed 40000 transplants for the first time says Brian Shepard the CEO of UNOS Thats the most ever done in a year in the US he says While the milestone is noteworthy and transplant surgeons call it a remarkable number thats cause for celebration they also acknowledge that much work needs to be done to address the lengthy waiting list for organs and other major issues The transplant system has come under fire recently both from a congressional committee that has been investigating it for 2 years and from the National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine which issued a report earlier this year recommending changes The industry has been called out for transportation glitches discarded organs lifethreatening mistakes and other serious problemsThe challenges are shared by the several organizations making up the complicated transplant system UNOS oversees 252 transplant centers and 57 regional organizations called organ procurement organizations or OPOs which service a specific geographic area A 1984 law created the first computerized government system that matches sick patients with needed organs the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network or OPTN The government sought bids for an organization to run it and UNOS has done that since 1986 While transplant surgeons and others in the industry acknowledge issues they also point to advances they only dreamed about decades ago Its a landmark milestone says Deepali Kumar MD president of the American Society of Transplantation Transplant medicine has had a huge impact not only on the individual but also on society People can live longer with better quality of life and its also allowed individuals to contribute to society Progress is being made on many fronts researchers and transplant surgeons say In one report a team of researchers highlighted the improved ability to successfully transplant organs into adults age 75 and above better immunosuppressive management needed to avoid rejection and better transplant techniques among other advances We are making progress in better immune suppressive drugs agrees Yuri S Genyk MD a transplant surgeon and codirector of the University of Southern California Transplant Institute Eventually one goal would be to find a way to suppress an immune response from the specific organ that was transplanted without affecting the overall immune response says Timucin Taner MD PhD division chair of transplant surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester MN Survival after transplants has improved Genyk says In one recent report comparing the UK and US average survival after a transplant was fairly similar with US rates showing more than 22 years for kidney nearly 21 for liver nearly 15 for heart and over 9 for lung Different techniques of organ preservation have also improved resulting in an increase in organs suitable for transplant from donors Genyk and Taner sayAccording to UNOS common organ preservation times vary but now they are Despite these advances the waiting list remains long As of Sept 7 most of the 105799 people in the US on the transplant waiting list need a kidney Thats followed by a need for a new liver heart kidneypancreas lung pancreas intestine and heartlung Every day 17 people die waiting for an organ transplant according to the Health Resources and Services Administration an agency of the US Department of Health  Human Services Every 9 minutes someone is added to the transplant waiting list As of August 170 million Americans or roughly 52 of the population are registered organ donors according to federal statistics For the first half of 2022 more than 20000 of the 24414 transplants performed were from deceased donors and 3702 from living donors While 170 million potential donors may seem like a large number capable of handling the need not everyone who registers as a donor is able to donate Only 3 of every 1000 donors end up having a usable organ that allows for deceased organ donation according to UNOS Thats due to a variety of reasons Most of that comes down to the manner of their death says Shepard of UNOS The organ needs to be preserved to be able to be transplanted Someone who has a heart attack at home and dies there wont qualify he says So continuing to expand the pool of acceptable donors is necessary and also one of the biggest challenges says Shephard After its 2year investigation the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing Aug 3 noting a myriad of problems within the industry In a statement Committee chair Ron Wyden DOR summarized the findings Among them More than 1100 complaints were filed between 2010 and 2020 complaining that the regional organ procurement organizations did not complete mandatory tests for disease infection and blood types A patient in Florida got cancer from transplanted organs and the organ procurement organization sat on the evidence for months From 2008 to 2015 249 transplant recipients developed a disease from transplanted organs a quarter died Failing to deliver organs properly or on time often resulted in organs being discarded The UNOS computer system is outdated mismanaged and insecure About 6200 Americans die every year waiting for a transplant and thousands of organs including 1 in 4 kidneys end up being discardedLikewise the National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine report issued in February called out the US organ transplant system as demonstrably inequitable among other problems People of color along with rural residents are less likely than others to get a transplant Among the recommendations is to achieve equity within 5 years Better coordination is needed between the organ procurement organizations and the transplant centers waiting for those organs one transplant surgeon says There is often ongoing tension between the two entities he says with limitations set up by the OPOs affecting the transplant centers Attention also needs to focus on increasing the numbers of living donors others say To do that we need to remove barriers says Kumar the American Society of Transplantation president The main barrier is probably financial as donors may need to take time off work travel to the hospital and shoulder other expenses UNOS says it is addressing the issues and taking actions on a number of fronts including equity improvement and using more donated organs As for downtime of the computer system a point of criticism a UNOS spokesperson says that since 2003 the system has never been down for more than an hour outside of scheduled maintenance Although UNOS doesnt oversee organ transportation it is developing applications to help organ procurement organizations and transplant hospitals plan visualize and track organ shipments minimizing the risk of loss It is also designing new methods to match donor organs to patients more efficiently Transplant candidates are aware of the issues but many focus happily on the outcomes and a better quality of life Dale Jaffe 67 a hypnotherapist in Ashland OR had a kidney transplant midpandemic in June 2021 The need for it wasnt a surprise He has high blood pressure and had decreased kidney function for a while he says I was just chugging along Then he learned it was time for the transplant His wife Lisa Hubler 61 also a hypnotherapist offered to donate one of her kidneys Dale got approved a week after his wifes kidney got acceptedWhat amazed me was really how simple it was he says Its not a complicated surgery He credits his basically good attitude and using hypnosis to keep himself calm Lisa says her decision to donate was a process At first I was like Of course I can do that Then she says reality sank in Shes a practitioner of Ashtanga yoga an intense form and wondered if she would still be able to do that After surgery she had to take 5 months off Many thoughts and questions went through her mind including Why do we have two kidneys if we only need one Now Dale and Lisa are back to hiking and pickleball For others the process is more difficult Kim Lute now 48 a regional communications manager for Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta has had two liver transplants the first in 1996 and the second in 2001 due to autoimmune conditions that attacked her liver An African American person Lute is writing a transplant memoir hoping to increase donor awareness within diverse communities Shes still on a fair amount of medicines and has some issues she says but I like to look on it as I have had a lot of wins And despite all the improvements a transplant may not last for the recipients lifetime More likely than not Uccellini says she will need another kidney transplant although she is hoping hers will last at least a few years longer Meanwhile she says I do what I can to keep myself healthy She also works in the field to improve the system for herself and others With a masters degree in public health she is a manager of policy and community relations at UNOS and hoping to make a

granted emergency use authorisation to a Covid19 vaccine in the USAThis has sadly resulted in nearly 118000 excess deaths compared to the 20152019 averageThe figures also reveal that there have been 7680 more excess deaths among children and young adults in 2022 so far compared to the same time frame in 2020 at the height of the alleged Covid19 pandemicBut the year 2021 was by and large the worst year for deaths among 0 to 44yearolds with 291461 excess deaths in total nearly 60000 more than occurred in 2020 And according to the official CDC figures this was mainly due to a mysterious sudden rise in deaths among children and young adults from around week 31 onwardsUnfortunately according to data published by the UK Government that mysterious sudden rise which has contributed to half a million American children and young adults dying since late 2020 is most likely due to the Covid19 injectionsLets not lose touchYour Government and Big Tech are actively trying to censor the information reported by The Expos to serve their own needs Subscribe now to make sure you receive the latest uncensored news in your inboxCompared to other countries the US Government has been terrible at publishing relevant and uptodate data allowing us to analyse the consequences of rolling out the Covid19 injections However we have finally managed to stumble upon it thanks to an institution known as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECThe OEC is an intergovernmental organisation with 38 member countries founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress and world trade And for some reason they host a wealth of data on excess deaths You can find that data for yourself hereThe following chart has been created using the figures found in the OEC database Figures that have been provided to the OEC by the US Centers for Disease Control CDC And it shows excess deaths among children and young adults aged 044 across the USA by week in 2020 and 2021The official figures reveal that there was a slight increase in excess deaths among children and young adults when the alleged Covid19 pandemic hit the US in early 2020However with the introduction of a Covid19 injection one would have expected deaths to have fallen significantly among the age group in 2021 But instead the opposite happenedExcess deaths among children and young adults were significantly higher every single week in 2021 than they were in 2020 except for weeks 29 and 30 But then in week 31 something drastic happened to cause excess deaths to rise significantly among children and young adultsAnd official figures provided by the CDC unfortunately show that trend has continued in 2022The most recent data released by the CDC covers up to week 40 the week ending October 9th and it should be noted that the last few weeks of data are subject to change But as you can see from the above 2022 has also been a significant year for excess deaths among children and young adultsJust for comparison heres how the figures for 2022 so far compare to the figures up to week 40 in 2020 and 2021The CDC has confirmed that there have been 7680 more excess deaths among children and young adults in 2022 so far than there were during the same time frame in 2020 at the height of the alleged Covid19 pandemicThe year 2021 was by and far the worst however with 27227 more excess deaths by week 40 following the rollout of the Covid19 injection than what occurred in 2020 at the height of the alleged Covid19 pandemicThe following chart shows the official CDC figures for all deaths and excess deaths among children and young adults across the USA prior to the rollout of the Covid19 vaccine and after the rollout of the Covid19 vaccines on the 14th Dec 2020The above figures reveal that the year 2022 so far has only seen 1352 fewer excess deaths among 044yearolds by week 40 than what occurred by week 51 in 2022 despite the year 2020 being the alleged height of the COVID pandemic and also including an extra 11 weeks worth of deathsBut the most concerning figures revealed in the above chart are the overall number of deaths and excess deaths among children and young adults since the rollout of the Covid19 injectionsNearly half a million people aged 0 to 44 have sadly died since week 51 of 2020 and this has resulted in an astounding 117719 excess deaths against the 20152019 fiveyear averageThe average life expectancy in the USA as of 2020 was 7728 years If we are to believe the official narrative that Covid19 is a deadly disease then we could perhaps agree that 231987 children and young adults up to the age of 44 dying in 2020 resulting in 40365 excess deaths was an unfortunate consequence of this diseaseBut if we are to believe the official narrative that Covid19 injections are safe and effective then how can one explain the further increase in death among children and young adults in both 2021 and 2022Because we know millions of Americans were coerced into getting the injections and we know millions of parents were coerced into forcing their children to also get the same injectionsThe answer lies in the fact that the official narrative is an outright lie The Covid19 vaccines are neitherThe data provided by the CDC which has been incredibly hard to find only gives us clues as to this being the case with so many deaths among young Americans But further data published by the UK Government confirms itOne of the pieces of evidence confirming this is a report published on the 6th of July 2022 by the UKs Office for National Statistics which is a UK Government agencyThe report is titled Deaths by Vaccination Status England 1 January 2021 to 31 May 2022 and it can be accessed on the ONS site here and downloaded hereTable 2 of the report contains the monthly agestandardised mortality rates by vaccination status by age group for deaths per 100000 personyears in England up to May 2022Weve taken the figures provided by the ONS for January to May 2022 and produced the following chart which reveals the horrific consequences of the mass Covid19 vaccination campaignThe chart shows the monthly agestandardised mortality rates by vaccination status among 18 to 39yearolds for NonCovid19 deaths in England between January and May 2022 In every single month since the beginning of 2022 partly vaccinated and double vaccinated 1839yearolds have been more likely to die than unvaccinated 18 to 39yearolds Triple vaccinated 18 to 39yearolds however have had a mortality rate that has worsened by the month following the mass Booster campaign that occurred in the UK in December 2021In January triple vaccinated 18 to 39yearolds were ever so slightly less likely to die than unvaccinated 18 to 39yearolds with a mortality rate of 298 per 100000 among the unvaccinated and 281 per 100000 among the triple vaccinatedBut this all changed from February onwards In February triple vaccinated 18 to 39yearolds were 27 more likely to die than unvaccinated 18 to 39yearolds with a mortality rate of 267 per 100k among the triple vaccinated and 21 per 100k among the unvaccinatedThings unfortunately got even worse for the triple vaccinated by May 2022 though The data shows that triple vaccinated 18 to 39yearolds were 52 more likely to die than unvaccinated 18 to 39yearolds in May with a mortality rate of 214 per 100k among the triple vaccinated and 141 among the unvaccinatedThe worst figures so far though are among the partly vaccinated with May seeing partly vaccinated 18 to 39yearolds 202 more likely to die than unvaccinated 18 to 39yearoldsThat same report also reveals the mortality rates for children although the UK Government did try to hide themThe following chart shows the mortality rates by vaccination status per 100000 personyears among children aged 10 to 14 in England for the period 1st January 2021 to 31st May 2022 according to the figures provided by the ONS In regard to Covid19 deaths the ONS reveals that the mortality rate among unvaccinated children aged 10 to 14 equates to 031 But in regards to onedose vaccinated children the mortality rate equates to 324 per 100000 personyears and in regards to triple vaccinated children the mortality rate equates to a shocking 4129 per 100000 personyearsUnfortunately there is little improvement when it comes to nonCovid19 deathsThe allcause death mortality rate equates to 639 per 100000 personyears among unvaccinated children and is ever so slightly higher at 648 among partly vaccinated childrenHowever the rate goes from bad to worse following the administration of each injection The allcause death mortality rate equates to 9728 among doublevaccinated children and a shocking 28902 per 100000 personyears among triplevaccinated childrenThis means according to the UK Governments own official data double vaccinated children are 1422  1522x more likely to die of any cause than unvaccinated children Whilst triple vaccinated children are 4423  4523x more likely to die of any cause than unvaccinated childrenThe figures provided by the Office for National statistics and both agestandardised and rates per 100000 population Therefore they are definitive proof that the Covid19 injections increase a persons risk of dying Which means the Covid19 injections have been and are continuing to kill peopleThis is why it should come as no surprise to find that a secret CDC report confirms half a million American children  young adults have died following the COVID vaccine rollout resulting in nearly 11800 excess deaths against the 20152019

CDI The DEBUT challenge totaling 65000 in prizes is supported by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering NIBIB part of the National Institutes of Health and VentureWell a nonprofit highereducation network that cultivates revolutionary ideas and promising inventionsDEBUT received 52 applications from 32 universities in 18 states engaging a total of 250 students this year NIBIB selected four winning teams for designs that excel according to four criteria the significance of the problem being addressed the impact on clinical care the innovation of the design and the existence of a working prototype An additional prize for a project focused on HIVAIDS was awarded with funds from the NIH Office of AIDS Research The winning project helps avoid the spread of bloodborne illness such as HIV by preventing scalpel blades from causing lacerations in the operating room VentureWell selected two more teams based on two additional criteria market potential and patentability The prizes will be awarded in a ceremony at the annual Biomedical Engineering Society BMES conference in Philadelphia on Oct 17 2019The DEBUT awards recognize undergraduate student design teams working on challenging healthcare problems that impact millions of people around the world said Bruce J Tromberg PhD Director of NIBIB We are proud to team up with VentureWell and BMES to celebrate these exceptionally talented students and their mentors Its inspiring to learn about each teams commitment to make a difference in the lives of patientsNIBIBs firstplace prize renamed this year to Steven H Krosnick prize of 20000 went to In Touch An Intubation Guidance System Intubations are often performed by nonexpert healthcare workers outside of the operating room such as emergency medical technicians or residents and can fail as often as 49 of the time which can cause hypoxia hypotension and even death The team from Columbia University New York City developed a tool to help make intubation easier by providing the user with feedback that informs them when they are incorrectly pushing the tube into the trachea or esophagus Limited testing has shown that it significantly decreases the amount of time it takes a novice to correctly intubate and greatly increases the chance that they will be successful on their first tryThe second place NIBIB award of 15000 went to a team from Georgia Institute of Technology Atlanta that developed a rapid screening test called C Differently to screen for CDI The current tests for CDI take more than an hour require a trained lab technician and are costly More than 90 of those tests will be negative C Differently developed a test that can rule out CDI within five minutes This could save hospitals and estimated 250 million in unnecessary testing costs In addition since it is paper based portable and does not require expertise to use it is significantly cheaper than traditional testing  lowering costs for hospitals and patientsNIBIBs third place prize of 10000 was awarded to a team from Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh for their device that helps patients with tracheostomies A tracheostomy involves cutting an opening in the neck where a tube can be inserted to allow air to go into the trachea and reach the lungs of patients who experience difficulty breathing While this procedure allows a patient to breathe on his own it also prevents him from being able to speak since most of the air from the lungs goes out through the tracheostomy tube and cannot drive the vocal cords into vibration Another major problem is that patients suffer from an excess of mucus buildup in the throat because they are breathing in dry air that has bypassed the normal pathway through the nasal cavity that regulates its humidity The attachment developed by the students combines a filter that captures humidity reducing mucus and a plug that blocks exhalation and enables the patients to speak It is designed so the patient can switch back and forth easily between the two functions The device is also reusableThe Venture Prize of 15000 was awarded by VentureWell to The Cath Path a device that helps women to selfcatheterize designed by a team from Stanford University California More than 250000 women in the United States suffer from neurogenic bladder  a condition in which bladder control is compromised The solution to this is to use a catheter four to six times a day to void the bladder However females often face difficulty locating the urethra and inserting the catheter correctly This can result in social embarrassment and urinary tract infections The Cath Path features a vaginal insert that aligns the catheter guide with the urethra and helps women insert the catheter without assistanceVentureWells Design Excellence Prize of 5000 went to Axexo an arm exoskeleton developed by a team from Virginia Polytechnic Institute Blacksburg Virginia Medical arm exoskeletons are used to support a users arm against the load of gravity They can be used for medical reasons such as stroke patients who need extra support or by professionals performing delicate or repetitive motions for long periods of time such as doctors Currently available exoskeletons are either fully supportive or compact but not both The Axexo was designed to be compact enough to be worn under a shirt while still supportive enough that the users arm feels nearly weightless as they perform tasksThis years winners have developed compelling solutions addressing a broad range of urgent needs said Phil

623,382,"""In children with rhabdomyosarcoma or RMS a rare cancer that affects the muscles and other soft tissues the presence of mutations in several genes including TP53 MYOD1 and CDKN2A appears to be associated with a more aggressive form of the disease and a poorer chance of survival This finding is from the largestever international study on RMS led by scientists at the National Cancer Institutes NCI Center for Cancer Research part of the National Institutes of HealthThe study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology on June 24 provides an unprecedented look at data for a large cohort of patients with RMS offering genetic clues that could lead to more widespread use of tumor genetic testing to predict how individual patients with this childhood cancer will respond to therapy as well as to the development of targeted treatments for the diseaseThese discoveries change what we do with these patients and trigger a lot of really important research into developing new therapies that target these mutations said Javed Khan MD of NCIs Genetics Branch who led the studyThe standard therapy for RMS is almost a year of chemotherapy radiation therapy and surgery These children get a lot of toxic treatments said the studys first author Jack Shern MD of NCIs Pediatric Oncology Branch If we could predict whos going to do well and whos not then we can really start to tailor our therapies or eliminate therapies that arent going to be effective in a particular patient And for the children that arent going to do well this allows us to think about new ways to treat themRMS is the most common type of soft tissue sarcoma in children In patients whose cancer has remained localized meaning that it has not spread combination chemotherapies have led to a fiveyear survival rate of 7080 But in patients whose cancer has spread or come back after treatment the fiveyear survival rate remains poor at less than 30 even with aggressive treatmentDoctors have typically used clinical features such as the location of the tumor in the body as well as its size and to what extent it has spread to predict how patients will respond to treatment but this approach is imprecise More recently scientists have discovered that the presence of the PAXFOXO1 fusion gene that is found in some patients with RMS is associated with poorer survival Patients are now being screened for this genetic risk factor to help determine how aggressive their treatment should beScientists have also begun using genetic analysis to dig more deeply into the molecular workings of RMS in search of other genetic markers of poorer survival In this new study  the largest genomic profiling effort of RMS tumors to date  scientists from NCI and the Institute for Cancer Research in the United Kingdom analyzed DNA from tumor samples from 641 children with RMS enrolled over a twodecade period in several clinical trials Scientists searched for genetic mutations and other aberrations in genes previously associated with RMS and linked that information with clinical outcomes Among the patterns that emerged patients with mutations in the tumor suppressor genes TP53 MYOD1 or CDKN2A had a poorer prognosis than patients without those mutationsUsing nextgeneration sequencing researchers found a median of one mutation per tumor Patients with two or more mutations per tumor had even poorer survival outcomes In patients without the PAXFOXO1 fusion gene more than 50 had mutations in the RAS pathway genes although RAS mutations did not appear to be associated with survival outcomes in this studyThe researchers believe that although they have identified the major mutations that may drive RMS development or provide information about prognosis they have only scratched the surface in defining the genetics of this cancer with many more mutations yet to be discovered They note that more work is needed to identify targeted drugs for those mutations and future clinical trials could incorporate genetic markers to more accurately classify patients into treatment groups Two NCIsponsored Childrens Oncology Group clinical trials are currently being developed using these markers and all participants will have their tumors molecularly profiledThe researchers hope that routine tumor genetic testing for rare cancers such as RMS will soon be a standard part of the treatment plan as it is for more common cancers such as breast cancerGenetic testing is going to become the standard of care said Dr Shern Instead of just the pathologists looking at these tumors were now going to have molecular profiling and thats a leap forwardThis study was conducted by an international consortium comprised of scientists at NCI and the Childrens Oncology Group in the United States and the

among collegeaged adults observed between 2017 and 2019 During this time the percentage of collegeaged adults who reported vaping marijuana in the past 30 days more than doubled from 5 to 14 for college students and 8 to 17 for noncollege respondents In 2020 these increases leveled off with 12 of college students and 14 of noncollege respondents reporting vaping marijuana in the past 30 days Similarly there was a nonsignificant change for vaping nicotine in 2020 with 19 of college students and 24 of noncollege respondents reporting vaping nicotine in the past 30 days compared to 22 and 18 in 2019 and 6 and 8 in 2017 respectivelyHallucinogen use Past year use of hallucinogens including LSD psilocybin mushrooms and other psychedelic substances significantly increased among college students between 2019 and 2020 In 2020 nearly 9 of college students reported the use of any hallucinogens in the past year compared to 5 in 2019 Among noncollege respondents annual use did not significantly increase in 2020 remaining consistent at around 10 compared to 8 in 2020Alcohol use In 2020 college students reported significantly lower alcohol use across numerous measures compared to 2019 with 56 of students reporting alcohol use within the past 30 days compared to 62 in 2019 and 28 reporting being drunk in the past 30 days compared to 35 in 2019 For both measures the trends in alcohol use had remained level between 2015 and 2019 In addition 24 of college students reported binge drinking consuming five or more alcoholic drinks in a row in the past two weeks in 2020 compared to 32 in 2019Among noncollege respondents trends in alcohol use across all measures were stable over the past five years with no drop in 2020 In 2020 49 of noncollege respondents reported alcohol use in the past 30days 22 reported being drunk in the past 30 days and 24 reported binge drinkingHistorically college students have reported the highest levels of binge drinking compared to sameaged youth who are not enrolled in college This is the first year where binge drinking was similar between the two groups said John Schulenberg PhD professor of psychology at the University of Michigan and principal investigator of the Monitoring the Future panel study While binge drinking has been gradually declining among college students for the past few decades this is a new historic low which may reflect effects of the COVID19 pandemic in terms of reduced time with college friendsOther highlights from the 2020 survey results on collegeage adults include Cigarette smoking continued to decline over the past five years to alltime lows over the past four decades in 2020 with 4 of college students reporting having smoked in the past month and 13 of noncollege respondents reporting having smoked in the past month Nonmedical use of amphetamines including misuse of ADHD medications like Adderall continued to decline for college students with a significant fiveyear decline in annual use to 65 in 2020 Though college students have typically had higher prevalence of nonmedical amphetamine use over the past decade this gap closed in 2020 with 6 of noncollege youth reporting past year use

rumors it has gathered from as far back as 2013 do offer a striking general picture of what people worry about when it comes to refugees Out of 40 different types of rumors gathered in the Hoaxmap almost twothirds pertained to only two types of crimes some kind of theft or attempted theft and some type of sexual assault or attempted sexual assault Stories of parking violations murder terrorism and even swan poaching may pop up occasionally but simply dont proliferate in the same wayOn the one hand some of these rumors may have been kicked off by actual events in particular the widely publicized New Years Eve assaults in the German city of Cologne wherein hundreds of women reported being robbed or groped by groups of men described by the police chief as appearing largely from the North African or Arab world Among the dozens of suspects identified later most fell into what Colognes prosecutor described as the general category of refugees mainly from North AfricaAt the same time the pervasive fear of refugeerelated crime on display both in German publicopinion polls and Hoaxmap rumors is out of sync with the data so far on the actual relationship between refugees and crime rates in Germany Recent numbers from Germanys Federal Criminal Police Agency BKA suggest that the influx of refugees into the country this fall had a low impact on crime numbers relative to the natural uptick that would happen with any population increase Although the number of refugees in the country increased by 440 percent between 2014 and 2015 the number of crimes committed by refugees only increased by 79 percent The number of crimes against refugees increased as well Furthermore according to Deutsche Welles analysis of the report the number of offenses increased in the first half of 2015 but stagnated in the second half precisely when most of the refugees were arriving and the rumor mill switched into overdrive And although sexual offenses account for over 25 percent of the rumors on the Hoaxmap the BKA data showed that only 1 percent of refugeerelated crimes fell into the sexual offense categorySome of this imbalance between documented crime and crime rumors sociologists and immigration experts I spoke to suggest may reflect underlying rules about how rumors spread and the feelings people are primed to have about immigrants Specifically rumors are more likely to take off when a factual event similar to the rumor has already occurred as well as when they tap into an underlying fear Swanpoaching is never going to rival sexual assault in terms of rumor powerGary Alan Fine a sociology professor at Northwestern University who coauthored a foundational book on the social psychology of rumors as well as a 2010 volume on rumors about terrorism and immigration pointed to the Cologne assaults as a kind of template for what people think is plausible He noted Once you have a plausible story then the criteria for information you need in order to believe a new story is much lower because you would say this is like what happened elsewhere Indeed almost half of the Hoaxmaps 76 reports concerning rape and sexual violence occurred in the two months following reports of the Cologne attacksRumors are more likely to take off when a factual event similar to the rumor has already occurredAnd because of how people process information some stories that appear to be coming out of different cities could even be variations on the same story One of the things that is easiest to forget and to change said Fine is the location of the event When a striking story pops up in the United States for example people in Detroit will say oh that happened in Detroit People in Phoenix will say it happened in Phoenix Dates and locationsin this case perhaps even a date as memorable as New Years Eveslip out of focus because they arent central to the storys social meaning What people would remember is if the perpetrator in a story was a Middle Eastern refugee Fine said Some things get leveled out because we dont see them as particularly crucial to the story It happened on Thursday Tuesdayit doesnt really matter Chicago or Detroit doesnt really matter But it matters in terms of the meaning of the story whether it involves Syrian refugee African American or Hispanic person Those kinds of issues become the basis of what makes for a widely spread storyThis unconscious information substitution he cautioned doesnt make the stories hoaxes as the name Hoaxmap suggests Hoax implies that someone is deliberately spreading false information in order to trick someone for some kind of personal benefit he said and I dont think thats whats going on Its more likely he said that the rumors have their basis in understandable fears Natalia BanulescuBogdan of the Migration Policy Institute echoed the point Immigration she said can act as a proxy for existing insecuritiesExisting insecurities can be maddeningly difficult to pin down Justin Berg who has researched attitudes toward immigration in the United States noted via email that numerous forms of social priming can contribute to fear of refugees in addition to straightforward environmental factors like the underlying crime rate and the actual number of new arrivals in any given place The regions the Hoaxmap reports as sporting the really big numbers of crime rumors are not necessarily the regions with the highest crime rates nor are they even the regions with the largest numbers of refugees Various forms of threat political ideology political party racism type of immigrant contact personal education and media typically play larger roles Berg said especially when the influx of immigration is relatively quick like it has been in Europe recentlyIn the case of rape rumors specifically research from the past few decades shows that the type of perceived threat may matter a great deal In the United States among younger women  rape is feared more than any other crime including homicide Mark Warr a sociology professor at the University of Texas at Austin who studies patterns in both crime and fear of crime pointed out via email Because of that even a small increase in apparent risk like a locally reported rape or rapes can generate substantial and widespread fear Thus the sexual assaults in Cologne might easily have an outsized impact in the rumor world as compared to other reported crimesEven a small increase in apparent risk can generate substantial and widespread fearAdditionally the early demographics of refugees arriving in Germany may have had some effect By the end of 2015 the arrivals were almost a quarter children which was extraordinary said BanulescuBogdan But earlier the flows were predominantly male and came from majorityMuslim countries she said and this idea that young Muslim men wouldnt have respect for women became pervasive Anglophone Twitter may have mocked the Bavarian Radios cartoon guide for refugees which featured a large orange X over a picture of a man groping a woman but the drawing probably reflected genuine German concerns at the timeFinally theres another possible contributor to the prevalence of rumors about refugees and crime especially sexual assault the medias own apparent reluctance to offer reliable reports of refugee crime Although police reportedly received 170 complaints regarding women being groped and robbed near the train station in Cologne on New Years Eve it took until January 5 for the story to make national and international headlines and even longer for arrests to be made The perceived footdragging and bias according to BanulescuBogdan really exacerbated peoples fears They thought everybodys trying to tell us that we have no reason to be fearful that our anxieties are illegitimate in some way and look what happened What else are they covering upThat question goes to the heart of rumors power Fine pointed out Whom do you trust What one person considers reliable another may find suspect and just as some of the individuals spreading rumors may have reason to feel vulnerable governmental institutions may have a reason for downplaying reports When one particular report appears to be downplayed that adds to skepticism about establishment information sourcesUnfortunately for establishment politicians epistemology rarely wins elections Fear on the other hand has a pretty good track record As the number of rumors tracked by the activists at Hoaxmap has risen so have the poll numbers for the rightwing and deeply antiimmigration party Alternative fr Deutschland Alternative for Germany Unless public fear of the ramifications of refugee presence can be allayed both those numbersregardless of the success of the EUTurkey deal slowing the flow of newcomersmay continue to rise""",LeadStories,fake,1,465

625,384,"""Study suggests scientists may need to rethink which genes control agingNIH scientists discover that bacteria may drive activity of many hallmark aging genes in fliesTo better understand the role of bacteria in health and disease National Institutes of Health researchers fed fruit flies antibiotics and monitored the lifetime activity of hundreds of genes that scientists have traditionally thought control aging To their surprise the antibiotics not only extended the lives of the flies but also dramatically changed the activity of many of these genes Their results suggested that only about 30 of the genes traditionally associated with aging set an animals internal clock while the rest reflect the bodys response to bacteriaFor decades scientists have been developing a hit list of common aging genes These genes are thought to control the aging process throughout the animal kingdom from worms to mice to humans said Edward Giniger PhD senior investigator at the NIHs National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS and the senior author of the study published in iScience We were shocked to find that only about 30 of these genes may be directly involved in the aging process We hope that these results will help medical researchers better understand the forces that underlie several agerelated disordersThe results happened by accident Dr Ginigers team studies the genetics of aging in a type of fruit fly called Drosophila Previously the team showed how a hyperactive immune system may play a critical role in the neural damage that underlies several aging brain disorders However that study did not examine the role that bacteria may have in this processTo test this idea they raised newborn male flies on antibiotics to prevent bacteria growth At first they thought that the antibiotics would have little or no effect But when they looked at the results they saw something interesting The antibiotics lengthened the flys lives by about six days from 57 days for control flies to 63 for the treated onesThis is a big jump in age for flies In humans it would be the equivalent of gaining about 20 years of life said Arvind Kumar Shukla PhD a postdoctoral fellow on Dr Ginigers team and the lead author of the study We were totally caught off guard and it made us wonder why these flies took so long to dieDr Shukla and his colleagues looked for clues in the genes of the flies Specially they used advanced genetic techniques to monitor gene activity in the heads of 10 30 and 45day old flies In a previous study the team discovered links between the age of a fly and the activity of several genes In this study they found that raising the flies on antibiotics broke many of these linksOverall the gene activity of the flies fed antibiotics changed very little with age Regardless of their actual age the treated flies genetically looked like 30day old control flies This appeared to be due to a flat line in the activity of about 70 of the genes the researchers surveyed many of which are thought to control agingAt first we had a hard time believing the results Many of these genes are classical hallmarks of aging and yet our results suggested that their activity is more a function of the presence of bacteria rather than the aging process said Dr ShuklaNotably this included genes that control stress and immunity The researchers tested the impact that the antibiotics had on these genes by starving some flies or infecting others with harmful bacteria and found no clear trend At some ages the antibiotics helped flies survive starvation or infection longer than normal whereas at other ages the drugs either had no effect or reduced the chances of survivalFurther experiments supported the results For instance the researchers saw similar results on gene activity when they prevented the growth of bacteria by raising the flies in a completely sterile environment without the antibiotics They also saw a similar trend when they reanalyzed the data from another study that had raised flies on antibiotics Again the antibiotics severed many of the links between aging and hallmark gene activityFinally the team found an explanation for why antibiotics extended the lives of flies in the remaining 30 of the genes they analyzed In short the rate at which the activity of these genes changed with age was slower than normal in flies that were fed antibioticsInterestingly many of these genes are known to control sleepwake cycles the detection of odorants and the maintenance of exoskeletons or the crunchy shells that encase flies Experiments on sleepwake cycles supported the link between these genes and aging The activity of awake flies decreased with age and this trend was enhanced by treating the flies with antibioticsWe found that there are some genes that are in fact setting the bodys internal clock said Dr Giniger In the future we plan to locate which genes are truly linked to the aging process If we want to combat aging then we need to know precisely which genes are setting the clockThis study was supported by the NIH Intramural Research Program at the NINDSThis press release describes a basic research finding Basic

conducted by the Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group PEDIG and supported by the National Eye Institute NEI part of the National Institutes of HealthPreterm babies are at high risk of abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina the lightsensitive tissue in the back of the eye These abnormal blood vessels are fragile and prone to leaking If left untreated vessel growth can lead to scarring and retinal detachment the main cause of ROPrelated vision loss ROP is one of the leading causes of blindness in childrenEstablished ROP treatments include laser therapy and cryotherapy Both interventions work by causing the abnormal blood vessels to stop growing before they can cause scarring and retinal detachmentAvastin is one of several available drugs that inhibit abnormal blood vessel growth by suppressing the overproduction of a signal protein called vascular endothelial growth factor VEGFThe US Food and Drug Administration approved Avastin in 2004 as a cancer therapy Since then ophthalmologists have used it offlabel to inhibit abnormal blood vessel growth in ROP as well as in other ocular disorders Results from a clinical trial published in 2011 confirmed the benefit of using Avastin over laser therapy for treating the most severe cases of ROP which occur in a region of the retina known as posterior zone 1As a faster and easier treatment option antiVEGF eye injections were a welcomed alternative to laser therapy for treating severe ROP said the new studys protocol chair David Wallace MD MPH chair of ophthalmology at the Indiana University School of Medicine Laser therapy requires sedating the baby for as long as 90 minutes an Avastin injection takes much less time and is generally less stressful to the infantBut we know that antiVEGF agents injected into the eye also get into the bloodstream and doctors worry that inhibiting VEGF systemically could interfere with normal development of brain lung bone and kidney tissues he said Evidence suggests that injections of antiVEGF in the eye reduce levels of VEGF in the bloodstreamIn this study Wallace and colleagues in the NEIfunded PEDIG hoped to pinpoint the lowest possible therapeutic dose of Avastin by testing progressively lower doses in 1014 infants per dose We didnt want to start by testing an ineffective dose and risk a child going blind so we started with 40 of the dose commonly used for ROP When a dose was successful we halved it and then tested that dose Eventually we cut the dose in half seven times he saidIn the current study we found that 0004 mg of Avastin  a dose thats merely 06 of the dose used in the 2011 study of Avastin for ROP  may be the lower limit to be effective for most infants with ROP said Wallace The findings set the stage for a randomized controlled trial comparing longterm effects of lowdose Avastin with laser therapy for treating ROP he saidThey plan to follow children over time to compare the longterm effects of each strategy on vision and organ development Previous studies suggest that babies treated with Avastin versus laser may be less likely to become myopic and require glasses for nearsightedness as they grow olderThe study involved 59 preterm infants with type 1 ROP the most severe form Each infant had one eye treated by a single injection containing 0016 mg 0008 mg 0004 mg or 0002 mg of Avastin If the other eye required treatment it received twice the concentration one dose level higher By comparison currently used doses of Avastin for ROP range from 025 mg to 0625 mgTreatment was considered a shortterm success if ROP improved by day four after therapy and if there was no recurrence or need for additional treatment within four weeks Such success was achieved in all eyes treated with the 0016 mg and 0008 mg doses and in 9 of 10 eyes receiving 0004 mg but only in 17 of 23 eyes receiving 0002 mg resulting in the conclusion that 0004 mg may be the lowest effective doseThe study was supported by NEI

technologies and scientific approaches throughout the field of environmental health sciences  applying his proven skills in scientific excellence creativity and rigor to improving public healthWoychik is highly respected for a long list of accomplishments in mammalian genetics and environmental epigenetics His laboratory was the first to identify a gene associated with polycystic kidney disease the first to connect a protocadherin gene ultimately linked to hearing loss in Cushings disease patients and the first to clone an obesityrelated gene called agouti Dr Woychik says his passion for epigenetics and environmental health sciences started when his research group discovered that the obesity trait associated with one of the agouti mutant mouse lines was influenced by the epigenome during embryonic developmentIndividuals with their unique biological makeup respond to the environment in different ways Our current research strategies mostly employ a one size fits all approach that does not factor in this critically important variable Dr Woychik explained My vision is to deal with the individual genetic epigenetic and biological variability in the establishment of research strategies for studying public health and environmental toxicologyAddressing environmental and genetic factors that contribute to health of the individual is generally referred to as precision medicine This is a major focus at NIH especially through the All of Us Research Program Dr Woychik will work closely with the All of Us leadership to contribute NIEHS research on environmental exposures toward this landmark programDr Woychik earned his PhD in molecular biology in 1984 from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland He moved into the field of molecular genetics during his

276,1248,"""New Zealand Scientists find Nanotech in Pfizer COVID ShotsWritten by Robin WesternaUndeclared Nanotech in the Pfizer Shots New Zealand Scientists Have Also Found It   For those who just want the short story Heres the picture of one drop of New Zealands Pfizer COMIRNATY vaccine under a cover slip after it was inadvertently heated lightly and viewed the same day through dark field microscopy at low magnification projected onto a TV monitorThese images below are after a new computer with decent graphics was purchased along with software for the cameraIncrease the magnification on the image below and look closelyThe long story goes like this I am a physician in good standing having a background in mathematics and physics from university then specialized beyond internal medicine after residency Ive had extensive phase contrast microscopy experiencePeople who were injured by the Pfizer jab started showing up in my practice At this time in 2021 I didnt have a microscope Several doctors had come forward in other countries to report strange observations Dr Zandre Botha from South Africa showed the uniform strange round circles La Quinta Columna showed what appeared to be microchips and other formationsTwo other doctors talked about parasites and of all things hydras This is not my first rodeo Having previously experienced how those of us that critically look at the vaccine situation are heavily infiltrated by persons wishing to divert and control the narrative I thought What is real What is put forth in order to lead questioners to look like foolsBecause of my previous extensive microscopy experience learning to use a dark field microscope didnt take a huge amount of education I took a 12 week course on live blood analysis using the most sophisticated dark field microscope and camera that my money could buy It magnifies up to 4000xAfter having a close look at the blood of dozens of vaccine injured people patients started asking me about certain round and square bright yellow formations in their capillary blood as seen on the screenNothing in the textbooks identified such things and various people doing similar work suggested that they might be crystals or some sort of slide or cover slip anomaly At first I just told the patients that it wasnt importantpossibly uric acid or something like that Then several empty vials of Pfizer COMIRNATY vaccine were obtainedI trust the source of the shots 100 percent The vials were from recent leftover vaccine after the shots had been given On a Friday in December alone in my office I took the vials out thawed and examined them I drew up all the contents just a few drops in each one from each vial into a 3cc syringe with a 16G needle and put one drop of it on a slide with a cover slip and another slide with a drop of vaccine mixed with a drop of human blood and put a cover slip on itThe images that follow are from the different slides and were taken immediately after the slides were madeThe amount of activity in the liquid and the strange shapes were baffling to say the leastSquares and circles seemed to connect up to each other consistently Over an hour or two the squares and circles seemed to enlarge somehowOn the same hot day I had to travel from my office to another office some distance away The slides were packed up in plastic slide mailers and placed in a cardboard box in the car alongside the microscope It had been a long week and the ocean looked enticing so I parked the car with the windows cracked about two inches went for a 40minute walk then continued my driveAt my destination the microscope was set up and I had another look at the slides I dont scare easily but what I saw next gave me a bit of a chillThe straight lines and corners were lined with squares rectangles and circlesWanting better graphics I purchased a gaming PC laptop The software was then useable and I could take future images from the video program attached to the camera for better definition If this was to be believed by anyone it had to be repeated and understood betterIn the days that followed I contemplated how the formation happened Was it a function of time Of the vibration in the car Heat Cell towers along the way It could have been any of those so I took some more of the liquid and plated out some more slides put them in multiple slide carriers drove them all around the city near cell towers for two hours and then came back I did get some additional interesting images but nothing like the first oneA few weeks later I got hold of some more vaccine from the same source This time there were lot numbers and four vials I plated them out separately and also mixed some of the old liquid with the new The new liquid had far more circles than the first lot and had fewer squaresInteresting that on the second day when I came back and relooked the structures had shifted off their foundations This may have been from handling the slides but it shows that the formations are things and not shadows or dehydrationAfter some more attempts interesting activity and organization occurred but no dramatic new images were madeI plated out another batch on the 16th of January Then I took them out in the car into the city on a hot day and left them in the car with the windows down It was around 28C outdoors and the car got to around 40C max When I got home this image was on the slide with a whole lot more The experiment was successfully repeatedIt is not for me to make assumptions on what these elements are but I dont think this is a normal finding in old style nonSARSCoV2 vaccines The organisation that occurred does not appear to be simply organic or debris or artefact and it is not simply dehydration of the slideIt is highly selforganised and appears to be part of the design of the liquid For so many months I had pondered why this infection was so severe and important that the vaccine has to be given to every human on the planet several timeseven if one has recovered from CovidThis is unprecedented in vaccine history Anyone with a dark field microscope can do this same thing Why arent more people looking at the vaccine under a microscope Why hasnt the public been informed of the full ingredients of the only FDA approved vaccine for CovidThe following images are from the slide which had one drop of fresh human blood mixed with one drop of vaccine liquid When the liquid met up to the blood the white blood cells were annihilated and the red blood cells heavily damagedWhile concentrating on getting as good a focus as possible I didnt think too much of what I captured But when I later looked closer it was obviously an image of some sort of nanotech chips linked by cords The cords may be made in part from fibrinBut what is certain is that when mixed with human blood different things than just vaccine alone happen on the slideThere were also these startling formationsI have nothing else to say The pictures speak for themselvesThis research should be continued by other laboratories Get some high quality German slides and cover slips Place a drop of vaccine from a used vial or a fresh vial Observe the activity at lower magnification and also at 1600 to 4000x using dark field microscopy Get a dry incubator for the fresh slides and set it at different temperatures ranging from 3842 for at least an hour Observe again If nothing interesting occurred try putting it back in the incubator Follow up the second day Do the same with a drop of blood and a drop of vaccine Combine different vaccine lots and use one drop of the combined vaccines on each slide Use PPE and vent the space so you are not breathing the liquid a laminar flow hood would be ideal and wear glovesSee more here

opioid misuseaddiction and pain from approximately 600 million in fiscal year 2016 to 11 billion in fiscal year 2018 made possible from a funding boost by Congress NIHs efforts contribute to a governmentwide push to meet the Presidents goal of ending the opioid crisisEvery day more than 115 Americans die after overdosing on opioids said Dr Collins That is a fourfold increase since 2000 and the numbers continue to climb NIH has been deeply invested in efforts to counter this crisis through research but we are determined to do even more Over the last year NIH has worked with stakeholders and experts across scientific disciplines and sectors to identify areas of opportunity for research to combat the opioid crisis The focus of these discussions has centered on ways to reduce the over prescription of opioids accelerate development of effective nonopioid therapies for pain and provide more flexible options for treating opioid addiction NIH is committed to bringing the full power of the biomedical research enterprise to bear on this crisisHEAL will bolster research across the NIH to Launch a longitudinal study to follow patients 1 after acute onset of musculoskeletal pain and 2 after surgery to identify biomarkers that might predict which individuals are more likely to transition from acute to chronic pain Leverage innovative imaging and omics neurotechnologies developed through the NIH BRAIN Initiative and SPARC program to identify 1 potential new targets for treatment of chronic pain and 2 objective biomarkers to predict which individuals will respond to a treatment

understanding of the mechanisms underlying addiction said Nora D Volkow MD director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse With these additional resources we can develop more customized highquality treatments for addiction and pain as well as harness implementation science to bring evidencebased changes to our healthcare system including treatment for those in the criminal justice environmentThe NIH HEAL Initiative will build on extensive wellestablished NIH research that has led to successes such as the development of the nasal form of naloxone the most commonly used nasal spray for reversing an opioid overdose the development of buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid use disorder and the use of nondrug and mindbody techniques to help patients control and manage pain such as yoga tai chi acupuncture and mindfulness meditation The Initiative will tap into the expertise of the NIH Pain Consortium which was established to enhance collaboration among NIH institutes centers and offices that conduct pain researchThis nationwide crisis stemmed initially from overprescribing of opioid medications to treat pain said Walter J Koroshetz MD director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke the lead NIH institute on pain The HEAL Initiative will develop the scientific evidence that informs best practices to effectively treat patients with pain while

study of healthy volunteers National Institutes of Health researchers have mapped out the brain activity that flows when we learn a new skill such as playing a new song on the piano and discovered why taking short breaks from practice is a key to learning The researchers found that during rest the volunteers brains rapidly and repeatedly replayed faster versions of the activity seen while they practiced typing a code The more a volunteer replayed the activity the better they performed during subsequent practice sessions suggesting rest strengthened memoriesOur results support the idea that wakeful rest plays just as important a role as practice in learning a new skill It appears to be the period when our brains compress and consolidate memories of what we just practiced said Leonardo G Cohen MD senior investigator at the NIHs National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS and the senior author of the study published in Cell Reports Understanding this role of neural replay may not only help shape how we learn new skills but also how we help patients recover skills lost after neurological injury like strokeThe study was conducted at the NIH Clinical Center Dr Cohens team used a highly sensitive scanning technique called magnetoencephalography to record the brain waves of 33 healthy righthanded volunteers as they learned to type a fivedigit test code with their left hands The subjects sat in a chair and under the scanners long coneshaped cap An experiment began when a subject was shown the code 41234 on a screen and asked to type it out as many times as possible for 10 seconds and then take a 10 second break Subjects were asked to repeat this cycle of alternating practice and rest sessions a total of 35 timesDuring the first few trials the speed at which subjects correctly typed the code improved dramatically and then leveled off around the 11th cycle In a previous study led by former NIH postdoctoral fellow Marlene Bnstrup MD Dr Cohens team showed that most of these gains happened during short rests and not when the subjects were typing Moreover the gains were greater than those made after a nights sleep and were correlated with a decrease in the size of brain waves called beta rhythms In this new report the researchers searched for something different in the subjects brain wavesWe wanted to explore the mechanisms behind memory strengthening seen during wakeful rest Several forms of memory appear to rely on the replaying of neural activity so we decided to test this idea out for procedural skill learning said Ethan R Buch PhD a staff scientist on Dr Cohens team and leader of the studyTo do this Leonardo Claudino PhD a former postdoctoral fellow in Dr Cohens lab helped Dr Buch develop a computer program which allowed the team to decipher the brain wave activity associated with typing each number in the test codeThe program helped them discover that a much faster version  about 20 times faster  of the brain activity seen during typing was replayed during the rest periods Over the course of the first eleven practice trials these compressed versions of the activity were replayed many times  about 25 times  per rest period This was two to three times more often than the activity seen during later rest periods or after the experiments had endedInterestingly they found that the frequency of replay during rest predicted memory strengthening In other words the subjects whose brains replayed the typing activity more often showed greater jumps in performance after each trial than those who replayed it less oftenDuring the early part of the learning curve we saw that wakeful rest replay was compressed in time frequent and a good predictor of variability in learning a new skill across individuals said Dr Buch This suggests that during wakeful rest the brain binds together the memories required to learn a new skillAs expected the team discovered that the replay activity often happened in the sensorimotor regions of the brain which are responsible for controlling movements However they also saw activity in other brain regions namely the hippocampus and entorhinal cortexWe were a bit surprised by these last results Traditionally it was thought that the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex may not play such a substantive role in procedural memory In contrast our results suggest that these regions are rapidly chattering with the sensorimotor cortex when learning these types of skills said Dr Cohen Overall our results support the idea that manipulating replay activity during waking rest may be a powerful tool that researchers can use to help individuals learn new skills faster and possibly facilitate rehabilitation from strokeThis study was supported by the NIH Intramural

880,1003,"""New findings from a study by researchers at the National Cancer Institute NCI part of the National Institutes of Health show that US incidence rates for aggressive subtypes of uterine cancer rose rapidly among women ages 30 to 79 from 2000 to 2015 The findings also reveal racial disparities including higher incidence of these aggressive subtypes and poorer survivalirrespective of subtype and cancer stageamong nonHispanic black women than among women in other racialethnic groupsThe study published May 22 2019 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology used population data from NCIs Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results SEER database to evaluate trends in uterine cancer incidence rates for women overall and by race and ethnicity geographic region and histologic subtype subtypes differentiated by how tumor tissue appears under a microscope The authors corrected for hysterectomy prevalence using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System in estimating incidence rates of uterine cancer because women who have had a hysterectomy are no longer at risk for developing the disease Many past studies of uterine cancer incidence did not include such a correctionIncidence rates of uterine cancer have been rising and there have been previous reports of racial differences in incidence and survival rates with disparities observed for nonHispanic black women said Megan Clarke PhD lead author of the study and a postdoctoral fellow in NCIs Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics But few recent studies have corrected for hysterectomy which can vary by race and ethnicity and by region Correcting for hysterectomy prevalence gives us a more accurate picture of trends in overall incidence as well as rates by race and ethnicityThe study found that among all women hysterectomycorrected uterine cancer incidence rates overall increased by about 1 per year from 2003 to 2015 Incidence rates increased more rapidly among women of other racialethnic groups than among white women Uterine cancer incidence rates among black women surpassed those among white women in 2007 and were consistently higher from 2011 through 2015The researchers also looked separately at data on endometrioid and nonendometrioid subtypes of uterine cancer Compared with nonendometrioid subtypes endometrioid subtypes are more common generally have better prognoses and survival rates and have a stronger association with hormonal risk factors and obesity A novel approach to account for missing histology information was used to improve subtypespecific incidence estimatesIncidence rates of endometrioid subtypes were stable in nonHispanic white women over the study period and increased in women of other racialethnic groups By contrast incidence rates of aggressive nonendometrioid subtypes have been increasing dramatically over time in all racialethnic groups overall increase of 29 per year from 2000 to 2015 The researchers also observed much higher rates of the aggressive nonendometrioid subtypes in black women 259 per 100000 women over the study period than in white women 114 Hispanic women 101 and AsianPacific Islander women 75The researchers also found that the 5year relative survival rate was lower among all women with nonendometrioid subtypes than among women with endometrioid subtypes and that black women had the lowest survival rates within each stage at diagnosis or histologic subtypeAll of these trends  the rates of uterine cancer among black women exceeding those of white women the higher incidence rates of nonendometrioid subtypes among black women and the lower survival rates of black women for all uterine cancerare very concerning Dr Clarke said We need to continue research to further understand these racial differences and disparities in order to help us better predict risk and work toward preventionOne key message from this study is that these aggressive nonendometrioid cancers are increasing for all women Dr Clarke said She explained that because these cancers are much rarer than endometrioid subtypes less is known about them Important next steps include conducting research on the underlying causes of these subtypes to improve risk prediction and early detection of all uterine cancersThe increasing incidence of nonendometrioid subtypes is not likely explained by the rising prevalence of obesity and changes in use of hormone replacement therapy as these factors are more strongly associated with the endometrioid subtypes the rates of which remained more stable over the study period Dr Clarke explainedIf the increasing incidence rate was primarily related to obesity we wouldnt see stable trends for endometrioid subtypes among white women she said Obesity is the strongest risk factor associated with endometrioid subtypes However our study suggests that there are other factors leading to the increases in incidence of uterine cancer and this warrants further researchAbout the

fallout from the COVID19 pandemic has been farreaching especially when it comes to the frustration over the inability to reach a doctor for an appointment let alone get answers to health questions And with the rise of telehealth and a substantial increase in electronic patient messages over the past 3 years inboxes are filling fast at the same time that doctor burnout is on the rise The old adage that timing is everything applies especially since technological advances in artificial intelligence or AI have been rapidly gaining speed over the past year The solution to overfilled inboxes and delayed responses may lie with the AIpowered ChatGPT which was shown to substantially improve the quality and tone of responses to patient questions according to study findings published in JAMA Internal Medicine There are millions of people out there who cant get answers to the questions that they have and so they post them on public social media forums like Reddit Ask Docs and hope that sometime somewhere an anonymous doctor will reply and give them the advice that they are looking for said John Ayers PhD lead study author and computational epidemiologist at the Qualcomm Institute at the University of CaliforniaSan Diego AIassisted messaging means that doctors spend less time worried about verb conjugation and more time worried about medicine he said rAskdocs vs Ask Your Doctor Ayers is referring to the Reddit subforum rAskdocs a platform devoted to providing patients with answers to their most pressing medical and health questions with guaranteed anonymity The forum has 450000 members and at least 1500 are actively online at any given time For the study he and his colleagues randomly selected 195 Reddit exchanges consisting of unique patient questions and doctor answers from last Octobers forums and then fed each full text question into a fresh chatbot session meaning that it was free of any prior questions that could bias the results The question doctor response and chatbot response were then stripped of any information that might indicate who or what was answering the question  and subsequently reviewed by a team of three licensed health care professionalsOur early study shows surprising results said Ayers pointing to findings that showed that health care professionals overwhelmingly preferred chatbotgenerated responses over the physician responses 4 to 1 The reasons for the preference were simple better quantity quality and empathy Not only were the chatbot responses significantly longer mean 211 words to 52 words than doctors but the proportion of doctor responses that were considered less than acceptable in quality was over 10fold higher than the chatbot which were mostly better than good And compared to doctors answers chatbot responses were more often rated significantly higher in terms of bedside manner resulting in a 98fold greater prevalence of empathetic or very empathetic ratings The past decade has demonstrated that there is a world of possibilities for AI applications from creating mundane virtual taskmasters like Apples Siri or Amazons Alexa to redressing inaccuracies in histories of past civilizations In health care AImachine learning models are being integrated into diagnosis and data analysis eg to speed up Xray computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging analysis or help researchers and clinicians collate and sift through reams of genetic and other types of data to learn more about the connections between diseases and fuel discovery The reason why this is a timely issue now is that the release of ChatGPT has made AI finally accessible for millions of physicians said Bertalan Mesk MD PhD director of The Medical Futurist Institute What we need now is not better technologies but preparing the health care workforce for using such technologies Mesk believes that an important role for AI lies in automating databased or repetitive tasks noting any technology that improves the doctorpatient relationship has a place in health care also highlighting the need for AI based solutions that improve their relationship by giving them more time and attention to dedicate to each other The how of integration will be key I think that there are definitely opportunities for AI to mitigate issues around physician burnout and give them more time with their patients said Kelly Michelson MD MPH director of the Center for Bioethics and Medical Humanities at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and attending physician at Ann  Robert H Lurie Childrens Hospital of Chicago But theres a lot of subtle nuances that clinicians consider when theyre interacting with patients that at least right now dont seem to be things that can be translated through algorithms and AIIf anything Michelson said that she would argue that at this stage AI needs to be an adjunct We need to think carefully about how we incorporate it and not just use it to take over one thing until its been better tested including message response she said Its really just a phase zero study And it shows that we should now move toward patientcentered studies using these technologies and not just willynilly flip the switch When it comes to the patient side of ChatGPT messaging several questions come to mind including relationships with their health care providers Patients want the ease of Google but the confidence that only their own provider may provide in answering said Annette Ticoras MD a boardcertified patient advocate serving the greater Columbus OH area The goal is to ensure that clinicians and patients are exchanging the highest quality informationThe messages to patients are only as good as the data that was utilized to give a response she said This is especially true with regard to bias AI tends to be kind of generated by existing data and so if there are biases in existing data those biases get perpetuated in the output developed by AI said Michelson referring to a concept called the black box The thing about the more complex AI is that oftentimes we cant discern whats driving it to make a particular decision she said You cant always figure out whether or not that decision is based on existing inequities in the data or some other underlying issue We need to be huge patient advocates and make sure that whenever and however AI is incorporated into health care that we do it in a thoughtful evidencebased way that doesnt take away from the essential human component that exists in medicine she said""",WebMD,real,0,1140

lymphatic system when administering immunotherapies may lead to better clinical outcomes for Alzheimers disease patients according to a new study in mice Results published April 28 in Nature suggest that treatments such as the immunotherapies BAN2401 or aducanumab might be more effective when the brains lymphatic system can better drain the amyloidbeta protein that accumulates in the brains of those living with Alzheimers Major funding for the research was provided by the National Institute on Aging NIA part of the National Institutes of Health and all study data is now freely available to the broader scientific communityA broad range of research on immunotherapies in development to treat Alzheimers by targeting amyloidbeta has not to date demonstrated consistent results said NIA Director Richard J Hodes MD While this studys findings require further confirmation the link it has identified between a wellfunctioning lymphatic system in the brain and the ability to reduce amyloidbeta accumulation may be a significant step forward in pursuing this class of therapeuticsAbnormal buildup of amyloidbeta is one hallmark of Alzheimers disease The brains lymphatic drainage system which removes cellular debris and other waste plays an important part in that accumulation A 2018 NIAsupported study showed a link between impaired lymphatic vessels and increased amyloidbeta deposits in the brains of aging mice suggesting these vessels could play a role in agerelated cognitive decline and Alzheimers The lymphatic system is made up of vessels which run alongside blood vessels and which carry immune cells and waste to lymph nodes Lymphatic vessels extend into the brains meninges which are membranes that surround the brain and spinal cordFor this new study the research team sought to determine whether changing how well the lymphatic drainage works in the brain could affect the levels of amyloidbeta and the success of antibody treatments that target amyloidbeta Using a mouse model of earlyonset Alzheimers researchers removed some of the lymphatic vessels in the brains of one group of mice They treated these mice as well as a control group with injections of monoclonal antibody therapies including a mouse version of aducanumabMice with less functional lymphatic systems had greater buildup of amyloidbeta plaques and of other immune cells that cause inflammation which is another factor in Alzheimers pathology Moreover when the researchers compared immune cells in the brains of human Alzheimers patients with those of the mice whose meningeal lymphatic system had been diminished they found that the genetic fingerprints of certain immune cells in the brain the microglia were very similar between people with the disease and mice with defective lymphatic vessels These mice also performed more poorly on a test of learning and memory performance suggesting that dysfunctional lymphatic drainage in the brain contributes to cognitive impairment and increases difficulties for antibodies that target amyloidbetaThe researchers also assessed whether boosting the brains lymphatic system could reverse these changes They injected mice with amyloidbeta antibody therapies along with a growth factor that enhances the function of the brains meningeal lymph vessels The treated mice showed not only lower accumulations of amyloidbeta but also expansion of some parts of the lymphatic system in the brains meningesThese findings suggest that supporting the meningeal lymphatic system in people with Alzheimers  and starting treatment early in the disease when this system is more intact  could lead to better outcomes said Molly V Wagster PhD chief of the Behavioral  Systems Neuroscience Branch in NIAs Division of NeuroscienceThe research also shows that if lymphatics are removed the mouse microglia  trash collector cells in the brain  are much closer to those in humans and that the genes upregulated in microglia upon lymphatic dysfunction are linked to different aspects of Alzheimers pathology Writing for the research team Jonathan Kipnis PhD at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis notes in the paper that these data demonstrate that it may be possible to devise strategies to therapeutically target microglia and the brain blood vasculature which are both important in Alzheimers pathophysiology by modulating meningeal lymphatic vasculatureThe researchers suggest that future studies may help identify how well the brains lymphatic system is working as we age That could result in targeted treatments that could improve how well the lymphatic system drains amyloidbeta and other compounds in turn slowing the progression of AlzheimersThis was funded in part by NIH grants R37AG034113

synapses according to a new study of prion protein accumulation in the eye by National Institutes of Health scientists Prion diseases originate when normally harmless prion protein molecules become abnormal and gather in clusters and filaments in the human body and brainUnderstanding how prion diseases develop particularly in the eye because of its diagnostic accessibility to clinicians can help scientists identify ways to slow the spread of prion diseases The scientists say their findings published in the journal Acta Neuropathologica Communications may help inform research on human retinitis pigmentosa an inherited disease with similar photoreceptor degeneration leading to blindnessPrion diseases are slow degenerative and usually fatal diseases of the central nervous system that occur in people and some other mammals Prion diseases primarily involve the brain but also can affect the eyes and other organs Within the eye the main cells infected by prions are the lightdetecting photoreceptors known as cones and rods both located in the retinaIn their study the scientists from NIHs National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton Montana used laboratory mice infected with scrapie a prion disease common to sheep and goats Scrapie is closely related to human prion diseases such as variant familial and sporadic CreutzfeldtJakob disease CJD The most common form sporadic CJD affects an estimated one in one million people annually worldwide Other prion diseases include chronic wasting disease in deer elk and moose and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattleUsing confocal microscopy that can identify prion protein and various retinal proteins at the same time the scientists found the earliest deposits of aggregated prion protein in cone photoreceptors next to the cilia tubelike structures required for transporting molecules between cellular compartments Their work suggests that by interfering with transport through cilia these aggregates may provide an important early mechanism by which prion infection selectively destroys photoreceptors At a later study timepoint they observed similar findings in rodsPrion protein also was deposited in cones and rods adjacent to ribbon synapses just before the destruction of these structures and death of photoreceptors Ribbon synapses are specialized neuron connections found in ocular and auditory neural pathways and their health is critical to the function of retinal photoreceptors in the eye as well as hair cells in the earThe researchers say such detailed identification of diseaseassociated prion protein and the correlation with retinal damage has not been seen previously and is likely to occur in all prionsusceptible species including peopleNext the researchers are hoping to study whether similar findings occur in retinas of people with other degenerative diseases characterized by misfolded host proteins such as Alzheimers and

in certain situations such as during your work break or after dinner before actually quitting Make a list of activities you can do instead of smoking like taking a brisk walk or chewing a piece of gum You have to be ready to do something else when you want to smoke Ask your doctor about using nicotine replacement therapy gum or patches Some people find these helpful in curbing cravings Join a smoking cessation support group or program Call your local chapter of the American Lung Association to find groups near you Tell your friends and family about your quit smoking plan and let them know how they can support you Why Is Smoking So Addictive Blame nicotine the main drug in tobacco for your smoking addiction Your brain quickly adapts to it and craves more and more to feel the way you used to feel after smoking just one cigarette Over time your brain learns to predict when youre going to smoke a cigarette You feel down and tired so you think I need a cigarette and the cycle starts again But its not just about brain chemistry Certain situations make you want to smoke Everyones triggers are different Yours might include the smell of cigarette smoke seeing a carton of cigarettes at the store eating certain foods or drinking your morning coffee Sometimes just the way you feel sad or happy is a trigger One of the biggest keys to quitting smoking is spotting the triggers that make you crave smoking and trying to avoid themHow Hard Will It Be to Quit Everyone is different and how tough it will be for you depends on How many cigarettes you smoke daily If your friends and family members smoke Focus on the benefits Within hours of quitting your body starts to recover from the effects of nicotine and additives Your blood pressure heart rate and body temperature  all of which are higher than they should be because of the nicotine in cigarettes  return to healthier levels You can breathe easier Poisonous carbon monoxide in your blood drops so your blood can carry more oxygen No doubt about it Quitting helps your entire body It can even improve your looks Youll be less likely to get wrinkles when youre still young And youll save money too How Can I Avoid Smoking Again Slipping is a common part of quitting For most people trying to quit even just one puff counts And if you have just one it makes it that much harder to go completely smoke free But slipping does not mean you go back to smoking regularly Use your slip up to focus on your triggers and learn how to better deal with cravings And to avoid further slip ups and relapses try the following If you live with a smoker ask them not to smoke around you When you get the urge to smoke take a deep breath Hold it for 10 seconds and release it slowly Repeat this several times until the urge is gone Keep your hands busy Doodle play with a pencil or straw or work on a computer Change activities that were connected to smoking Take a walk or read a book instead of taking a cigarette break Hang out with nonsmokers or go to places that dont allow smoking such as the movies museums shops or libraries Exercise Exercising will help you relax Get support for quitting especially from family and friends Work with your doctor to develop a plan using overthecounter or prescription nicotine replacement aidsWhen you quit smoking you will have both physical and mental withdrawals You may crave cigarettes feel irritable and hungry cough often get headaches or have difficulty concentrating You have these symptoms of withdrawal because your body is used to nicotine When withdrawal symptoms occur within the first 2 weeks after quitting stay in control Think about your reasons for quitting Remind yourself that these are signs that your body is healing and getting used to being without nicotine The withdrawal symptoms are only temporary They are strongest when you first quit but will go away within 10 to 14 days Remember that withdrawal symptoms are easier to treat than the major diseases that smoking can cause You may still have the desire to smoke since there are many strong associations with smoking The best way to overcome these associations is to enjoy them without smoking If you

breath and wheezing during bike rides At home he struggled with chores I was having a hard time climbing a flight of stairs just doing laundry says Blome who lives in the Chicago suburb of Palatine To get things under control he saw an allergist and started regular medications  two tablets two nasal sprays and inhaled corticosteroids each day plus an albuterol inhaler for flareups The inhalers have an extra feature an electronic monitor that attaches to the device and automatically tracks where and when the medication is used Bluetooth sends this information to an app on the patients mobile phone and to a dashboard where the medical team can see at a glance when symptoms are popping up and how regularly medications are taken  leading to the devices often being called smart inhalers At this years American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology AAAAI conference in Phoenix AZ researchers explained how digital monitoring devices can help diagnose and treat hardtocontrol asthma potentially reducing the need for oral steroids or biologic therapies Even though electric monitors have been on the market for years their use has been slow to catch on due to uncertainties around insurance coverage liability and how to manage and best use the data One recent study said these devices cost 100500 but that price depends on many things such as insurance About 17 of adult asthma patients have difficulttocontrol asthma meaning they limit their activity due to breathing symptoms and use reliever medications multiple times a week But research suggests that correcting inhaling technique and sticking to the use of the meds can cut that 17 down to just 37 says Blomes allergist Giselle Mosnaim MD of NorthShore University HealthSystem Mosnaim spoke about digital monitoring at a conference session on digital technologies for asthma management A study of more than 5000 asthma patients showed that if you have critical errors in inhaler technique this leads to worse asthma outcomes and increased asthma exacerbations she says It also shows that despite new devices and new technologies we still have poor inhaler techniqueYet adherence is poorly gauged by doctors and patient selfreporting The ideal measure of adherence should be objective accurate and unobtrusive to minimize impact on patient behavior and allow reliable data collection in realworld settings Mosnaim says So electronic medication monitors are the gold standard Patients not following instructions or guidelines is something we saw nonstop with kids says Caroline Moassessi founder of the allergy and asthma blog Gratefulfoodiecom who formerly served on a regional board of the American Lung Association Shes also the mother of two asthmatic children now in college who years ago used electronic medication monitors as part of a research trial They were unimpressed  mostly since I think they thought their asthma was controlled she says When patients are not in crisis they dont manage their asthma well Even in research studies such as the one Rachelle Ramsey PhD presented at the conference its not only hard to determine if better adherence leads to improved health but when For example does your adherence this week impact your asthma control this week or does it impact your asthma control next week Or is it even further out Do you need to have some level of adherence over the course of a month in order to have better outcomes at the end of that month says Ramsey a pediatric research psychologist at Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center I think its a little complicated That said results from several small studies do show a connection between remote monitoring and better clinical outcomes One study enrolled asthma patients in the United Kingdom and another was done by Mosnaim with Chicagoarea patients In the UK quality improvement project nurses asked patients with difficulttocontrol asthma if they knew how to use their inhalers and were following treatment guidelines Those who said yes were invited to swap their steroidinhalers for a controller fitted with a device that tracks use and measures acoustics to test inhaler technique After 28 days of monitoring many people in the study had better clinical outcomesAnd after 3 months of digital monitoring patients didnt use their rescue medication quite as often Blome has seen a marked improvement in his asthma since starting regular appointments and getting back on daily medications a year and a half ago He says that now and then he has wheezing and shortness of breath usually while biking or exercising But those symptoms arent as severe or frequent as before From a doctors perspective digital inhaler systems allow me to discern patterns in order to determine what triggers his asthma symptoms and to adjust medications at different times of the year Mosnaim says Electronic systems can monitor pollen counts and air quality as well as how often a patient uses a quick reliever medication Thus she says tracking these measures yearround could raise attention to impending asthma attacks and suggest when to increase the dose of controller medications or add other treatments""",WebMD,real,0,1778

781,769,"""Boosting energy levels within damaged nerves may help them healNIHfunded project in mice provides insights into why nerves fail to regrow following injuryWhen the spinal cord is injured the damaged nerve fibers  called axons  are normally incapable of regrowth leading to permanent loss of function Considerable research has been done to find ways to promote the regeneration of axons following injury Results of a study performed in mice and published in Cell Metabolism suggests that increasing energy supply within these injured spinal cord nerves could help promote axon regrowth and restore some motor functions The study was a collaboration between the National Institutes of Health and the Indiana University School of Medicine in IndianapolisWe are the first to show that spinal cord injury results in an energy crisis that is intrinsically linked to the limited ability of damaged axons to regenerate said ZuHang Sheng PhD senior principal investigator at the NIHs National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS and a cosenior author of the studyLike gasoline for a car engine the cells of the body use a chemical compound called adenosine triphosphate ATP for fuel Much of this ATP is made by cellular power plants called mitochondria In spinal cord nerves mitochondria can be found along the axons When axons are injured the nearby mitochondria are often damaged as well impairing ATP production in injured nervesNerve repair requires a significant amount of energy said Dr Sheng Our hypothesis is that damage to mitochondria following injury severely limits the available ATP and this energy crisis is what prevents the regrowth and repair of injured axonsAdding to the problem is the fact that in adult nerves mitochondria are anchored in place within axons This forces damaged mitochondria to remain in place while making it difficult to replace them thus accelerating a local energy crisis in injured axonsThe Sheng lab one of the leading groups studying mitochondrial transport previously created genetic mice that lack the proteincalled Syntaphilinthat tethers mitochondria in axons In these knockout mice the mitochondria are free to move throughout axonsWe proposed that enhancing transport would help remove damaged mitochondria from injured axons and replenish undamaged ones to rescue the energy crisis said Dr ShengTo test whether this has an impact on spinal cord nerve regeneration the Sheng lab collaborated with XiaoMing Xu MD PhD and colleagues from the Indiana University School of Medicine who are experts in modeling multiple types of spinal cord injurySpinal cord injury is devastating affecting patients their families and our society said Dr Xu Although tremendous progress has been made in our scientific community no effective treatments are available There is definitely an urgent need for the development of new strategies for patients with spinal cord injuryWhen the researchers looked in three injury models in the spinal cord and brain they observed that Syntaphilin knockout mice had significantly more axon regrowth across the injury site compared to control animals The newly grown axons also made appropriate connections beyond the injury siteWhen the researchers looked at whether this regrowth led to functional recovery they saw some promising improvement in fine motor tasks in mouse forelimbs and fingers This suggested that increasing mitochondrial transport and thus the available energy to the injury site could be key to repairing damaged nerve fibersTo test the energy crisis model further mice were given creatine a bioenergetic compound that enhances the formation of ATP Both control and knockout mice that were fed creatine showed increased axon regrowth following injury compared to mice fed saline instead More robust nerve regrowth was seen in the knockout mice that got the creatineWe were very encouraged by these results said Dr Sheng The regeneration that we see in our knockout mice is very significant and these findings support our hypothesis that an energy deficiency is holding back the ability of both central and peripheral nervous systems to repair after injuryDr Sheng also points out that these findings while promising are limited by the need to genetically manipulate mice Mice that lack Syntaphilin show longterm effects on regeneration while creatine alone produces only modest regeneration Future research is required to develop therapeutic compounds that are more effective in entering the nervous system and increasing energy production

added millions of candidate DNA switches from the human and mouse genomes that appear to regulate when and where genes are turned on and a new registry that assigns a portion of these DNA switches to useful biological categories The project also offers new visualization tools to assist in the use of ENCODEs large datasetsThe projects latest results were published in Nature accompanied by 13 additional indepth studies published in other major journals ENCODE is funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute part of the National Institutes of HealthA major priority of ENCODE 3 was to develop means to share data from the thousands of ENCODE experiments with the broader research community to help expand our understanding of genome function said NHGRI Director Eric Green MD PhD ENCODE 3 search and visualization tools make these data accessible thereby advancing efforts in open scienceTo assess the potential functions of different DNA regions ENCODE researchers studied biochemical processes that are typically associated with the switches that regulate genes This biochemical approach is an efficient way to explore the entire genome rapidly and comprehensively This method helps to locate regions in the DNA that are candidate functional elements  DNA regions that are predicted to be functional elements based on these biochemical properties Candidates can then be tested in further experiments to identify and characterize their functional roles in gene regulationA key challenge in ENCODE is that different genes and functional regions are active in different cell types said Elise Feingold PhD scientific advisor for strategic implementation in the Division of Genome Sciences at NHGRI and a lead on ENCODE for the institute This means that we need to test a large and diverse number of biological samples to work towards a catalog of candidate functional elements in the genomeSignificant progress has been made in characterizing proteincoding genes which comprise less than 2 of the human genome Researchers know much less about the remaining 98 of the genome including how much and which parts of it perform other functions ENCODE is helping to fill in this significant knowledge gapThe human body is composed of trillions of cells with thousands of types of cells While all these cells share a common set of DNA instructions the diverse cell types eg heart lung and brain carry out distinct functions by using the information encoded in DNA differently The DNA regions that act as switches to turn genes on or off or tune the exact levels of gene activity help drive the formation of distinct cell types in the body and govern their functioning in health and diseaseDuring the recently completed third phase of ENCODE researchers performed nearly 6000 experiments  4834 in humans and 1158 in mice  to illuminate details of the genes and their potential regulators in their respective genomesENCODE 3 researchers studied developing embryonic mouse tissues to understand the timeline of various genomic and biochemical changes that occur during mouse development Mice due to their genomic and biological similarity to humans can help to inform our understanding of human biology and diseaseThese experiments in humans and mice were carried out in several biological contexts Researchers analyzed how chemical modifications of DNA proteins that bind to DNA and RNA a sister molecule to DNA interact to regulate genes Results from ENCODE 3 also help explain how variations in DNA sequences outside of proteincoding regions can influence the expression of genes even genes located far away from a specific variant itselfThe data generated in ENCODE 3 dramatically increase our understanding of the human genome said Brenton Graveley PhD professor and chair of the Department of Genetics and Genome Sciences at UCONN Health The project has added tremendous resolution and clarity for previous data types such as DNAbinding proteins and chromatin marks

platforms manipulate the wellbeing and body image of young people around the world This will create a whole new set of beauty ideals that seem realistic says Sophia ChoukasBradley PhD a clinical psychologist and researcher at the University of Pittsburgh And because they are AIgenerated they can be manipulated to be very realistic but showing impossible body standards Humans are always comparing themselves to the people around them says Jasmine Fardouly PhD a social psychologist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney Australia And these comparisons are automatic and widespread From a young age weve internalized this idea that its really important to be physically attractive because then youll be successful and happy and everything wonderful will happen But these beauty ideals are so specific that very few people can actually attain them she saysHumans are social so this makes sense Fardouly says The social bonds that have enabled us to thrive as a species also mean that we are constantly comparing ourselves to the people around us to see how we measure up Just seeing a photo of another person  even a complete stranger  invites comparisons she says Advertisers have long used this part of human nature explains ChoukasBradley If we see a photo or video of a person we admire or want to imitate its a simple and powerful way to encourage people to buy what that person is selling In the 1900s advertisers used celebrities to both create beauty ideals and to sell the products needed to live up to those standards For most of us ChoukasBradley says these celebrities were removed from our everyday lives We didnt run into them at the grocery store or see them in grubby sweats without makeup Still psychologists have found that the perfectlooking images we saw in the pages of glossy magazines on TV and on billboards had a dramatic effect on how people thought about their own bodies A 1999 survey of 548 tween and teen girls in the journal Pediatrics showed that reading fashion magazines influenced perceptions of the ideal body in twothirds of respondents and made 47 want to lose weight Another study in the Journal of Adolescent Health in 2003 found that girls who frequently read fashion magazines were seven times more likely to diet for weight loss and six times more likely to use extreme unhealthy weight loss behaviors such as taking diet pills or laxatives In total a 2010 review article by body image researcher Michael Levine PhD and colleagues showed a consistent strong relationship between exposure to mass media and negative body image and disordered eating Weve come about as close as we can to proving a causeandeffect relationship between looking at thin idealized images and young women in particular feeling worse about their bodies says Jennifer Mills PhD a clinical psychologist at York University in Ontario CanadaGrowing awareness of the harm of mass media images came along with the rise of digital editing programs like Photoshop and with the advent of social media On one level says Jennifer Harriger PhD a psychologist at Pepperdine University in California the images seen on social media are an extension of those seen in advertisements They promote the same beauty ideals and often sell the same products And although many on social media like to pretend that their photos are spurofthemoment snaps the reality is that most influencers heavily edit their images using Photoshop digital filters and more Not surprisingly more research is revealing that social media has the same strong links between negative body image and eating disorder behaviors as traditional mass media What makes social media potentially more tricky Mills explains is that the images shown arent just celebrities theyre also classmates and coworkers Adding fuel to the fire is that the images are constantly changing and are tailored to each persons interests You could pick up an issue of Cosmo back in the day and another one wouldnt come out for another month so there was a finite amount of content that you could see Theres an infinite amount on social media she says This creates what researchers like ChoukasBradley call a perfect storm where images of idealized bodies join with adolescent female culture to emphasize the importance of a body type that is impossible to obtain To me its an illustration of the way in which a body has become a source of potential capital and social mobility in our societies says Rachel Rodgers PhD a psychologist at Northeastern University in Boston Theyre not just promoting the idea that you should look like this but that you could look like that if you only spent the time money and energy on the right products and services That theres a powerful sort of moral obligation to look that way Social media whistleblowers such as Frances Haugen  who testified before Congress about how social media sites harm children  have revealed that companies like Meta which owns Facebook and Instagram and TikTok are well aware of the impact their platforms have on the health and wellbeing of their youngest users Harriger explainsSome countries have tried to address this problem through legislation In June 2021 Norways legislature overwhelmingly passed a law requiring influencers and advertisers to post a disclaimer showing when a photo has been digitally altered Though these disclaimers are wellintentioned studies have shown they have no effect on our perceptions of the bodies in the photos and on our desires to look like them The reason is that our brains first process these images via an automatic and emotional pathway We might not even be aware that were making these comparisons because they happen so quickly and without conscious thought Fardouly explains We can only process disclaimers later via a second neural pathway thats slower taking seconds rather than milliseconds But by then the image has already hit home There is on research on AI influencers according to Fardouly and ChoukasBradley But all the experts who spoke with WebMD said their years of work suggests that the fact that these influencers are computergenerated will have little impact on how we perceive their bodies People will still want to look that way They will still make comparisons to those images and this will make them feel bad about themselves Fardouly says To date AI influencers like Kyra and Miquela have echoed existing beauty ideals rather than challenging the boundaries of what society calls beautiful As a result they further reinforce a narrow range of body shapes and sizes The fact that they arent real doesnt make much of a difference Mills hopes that AI influencers could offer a reprieve for reallife influencers who build their lives around the whims of algorithms and advertisers Being an influencer is really hard You always have to be doing interesting things and look beautiful Its the perfect job for an artificially created being because its not the life of a normal teen Mills says Digital influencers are also of course unpaid never age the way reallife characters do and will be free of the kinds of scandals other celebrities can sometimes get mixed up in""",WebMD,real,0,1691

2018,780,"""Findings suggest drugs targeting immune cells may not be effective in treating deadly disease mainly affecting childrenResearchers at the National Institutes of Health found inconclusive evidence that specific immune cells may play a key role in the devastating effects of cerebral malaria a severe form of malaria that mainly affects young children The results published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation suggest that drugs targeting T cells may not be effective in treating the disease The study was supported by the NIH Intramural Research ProgramThis is the first study showing some indication that T cells may target blood vessels in brains of children with cerebral malaria said Dorian McGavern PhD chief of the Viral Immunology and Intravital Imaging Section at the NIHs National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS who codirected the study with Susan Pierce PhD chief of the Laboratory of Immunogenetics at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID These findings raise questions about the role of T cells in the development of disease pathology in children It is well established that T cells cause brain vasculature injury associated with cerebral malaria in mice but this correlation may not hold true in humansMore than 200 million people worldwide are infected annually with mosquitoborne parasites that cause malaria In a subset of those patients mainly young children the parasites accumulate in brain blood vessels causing cerebral malaria which leads to increased brain pressure from swelling Even with available treatment cerebral malaria still kills up to 25 of those affected resulting in nearly 400000 deaths annually Children who survive the infection will often have longlasting neurological problems such as cognitive impairmentThe researchers led by Drs Pierce and McGavern examined brain tissue from 23 children who died of cerebral malaria and 11 children who died from other causes The scientists used stateoftheart microscopy to explore the presence of cytotoxic lymphocytes CTLs in the brain tissue samples CTLs are a type of T cell in our immune system that is responsible for controlling infections throughout the bodyCurrent treatment strategies for cerebral malaria focus on red blood cells which are thought to clog blood vessels and create potentially fatal blockages leading to extreme pressure in the brain However findings in the mouse model demonstrated that CTLs damage blood vessels leading to brain swelling and death The role of CTLs in cerebral malaria in children hasnt been thoroughly investigated prior to this studyThe results of the current study demonstrate a potential increased accumulation of CTLs along the walls of brain blood vessels in the cerebral malaria tissue samples compared to noncerebral malaria cases However the significance of this observation is uncertain and it is unclear whether the CTLs actually play a critical role in cerebral malaria by damaging the walls of brain blood vesselsThe disease appears to potentially involve the presence of CTLs but further research is needed to confirm their role said Dr McGavernIn separate studies we discovered some preliminary evidence that treatment of mice with a drug that targets T cells may have rescued over 60 of otherwise fatal cases of experimental cerebral malaria said Dr Pierce However the effectiveness of this drug in treating cerebral malaria in humans remains uncertainThe impact of HIV coinfection on the risk of developing cerebral malaria is not known The NIH researchers compared CTL patterns in the cerebral malaria cases that were coinfected with HIV and those that were HIV negative In the HIVnegative cases the CTLs were seen lining up against the inside wall of brain blood vessels In the HIVpositive cases the CTLs had migrated across the surface to the outside of the vessels There were also potentially more CTLs present in the HIVpositive cases but the significance of this observation is unclearTogether these findings raise questions about the potential role of CTLs in cerebral malaria and the effectiveness of drugs targeting T cells Additional research is needed to uncover the role of T cells in human cerebral malaria Future studies will also investigate the effectiveness of targeting T cells in treating the disease Plans for a clinical trial are underway to test the effects of a specific T cell blocker in cerebral malaria patients in MalawiThe NINDS is the nations leading funder of research on the brain and nervous system The

tested include mAb114 a single monoclonal antibody developed by NIAID with early support from the INRB and remdesivir also known as GS5734 an antiviral drug developed by Gilead Sciences Inc The trial has been approved to begin enrolling patients in these three groups and plans are underway to amend the trial to include REGNEB3 also known as REGN347034713479 a monoclonal antibody cocktail developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals IncThe participating Ebola treatment units will continue to provide all participants with supportive care for EVD Ebola care includes supportive oral andor intravenous fluids electrolyte replacement maintaining oxygen status and blood pressure and pain managementThe investigational treatments have varying levels of data to support their use from testing in the laboratory animals and humans However none has been approved for treating EVD ZMapp is the only investigational treatment previously tested in a randomized controlled efficacy trial Results from that study conducted in the US and West Africa during the 2014 to 2016 outbreak suggested that ZMapp appeared to be beneficial but as the outbreak waned the trial ultimately could not enroll enough participants to definitively establish the drugs efficacyThe investigational treatments also have been administered to most of the Ebola patients in the current outbreak in the DRC under an ethical framework developed by the WHO called Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered and Investigational Interventions MEURI However this emergencyuse mechanism cannot yield generalizable evidence on how well the treatments workA randomized controlled clinical trial is necessary to obtain reliable data about the safety and efficacy of investigational Ebola treatments said H Clifford Lane MD director of NIAIDs Division of Clinical Research It is possible to conduct rigorous clinical research in an outbreak setting and we anticipate this trial will provide useful dataProfessor JeanJacques MuyembeTamfum MD PhD directorgeneral of the INRB and Richard T Davey Jr MD deputy director of NIAIDs Division of Clinical Research are coprincipal investigators for the studyTrial participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of the investigational treatments by intravenous infusion Site clinicians will monitor patients symptoms and take blood samples for laboratory tests Patients will remain in the Ebola treatment unit until they fully recover from the disease They will be asked to return to the clinic approximately two months after receiving treatment for a checkup and to provide additional blood samples for laboratory testsPlans are underway to expand the trial beyond the ALIMA site in Beni to additional Ebola treatment units operated by medical humanitarian organizations including International Medical Corps The trial also may be adapted to continue across more than one outbreak and in several countries The number of participants enrolled in the trial ultimately will depend on the evolution of Ebola outbreaks The study is designed to enroll 112 patients per arm potentially over multiple outbreaksThis clinical trial marks a significant and important step forward for the DRC and our international partners said Dr Muyembe We are eager to learn more about each of these investigational treatments as we continue to work tirelessly to identify new cases trace contacts and control the spread of diseaseAn independent data and safety monitoring board will regularly review the study data For more information visit ClinicalTrialsgov and search identifier

129,27,"""By Peter A McCullough MD MPHFar and away the most common question I get from those who took one of the COVID19 vaccines is how do I get this out of my body The mRNA and adenoviral DNA products were rolled out with no idea on how or when the body would ever breakdown the genetic code The synthetic mRNA carried on lipid nanoparticles appears to be resistant to breakdown by human ribonucleases by design so the product would be longlasting and produce the protein product of interest for a considerable time period This would be an advantage for a normal human protein being replaced in a rare genetic deficiency state eg alpha galactosidase in Fabrys disease However it is a big problem when the protein is the pathogenic SARSCoV2 Spike The adenoviral DNA Janssen should broken down by deoxyribonuclease however this has not be exhaustively studiedThis leaves dissolution of Spike protein as a therapeutic goal for the vaccine injured With the respiratory infection Spike is processed and activated by cellular proteases including transmembrane serine protein 2 TMPRSS2 cathepsin and furin With vaccination these systems may be avoided by systemic administration and production of Spike protein within cells As a result the pathogenesis of vaccine injury syndromes is believed to be driven by accumulation of Spike protein in cells tissues and organsNattokinase is an enzyme is produced by fermenting soybeans with bacteria Bacillus subtilis var natto and has been available as an oral supplement It degrades fibrinogen factor VII cytokines and factor VIII and has been studied for its cardiovascular benefits Out of all the available therapies I have used in my practice and among all the proposed detoxification agents I believe nattokinase and related peptides hold the greatest promise for patients at this timeTanikawa et al examined the effect of nattokinase on the Spike protein of SARSCoV2 In the first experiment they demonstrated that Spike was degraded in a time and dose dependent manner in a cell lysate preparation that could be analogous to a vaccine recipient The second experiment demonstrated that nattokinase degraded the Spike protein in SARSCoV2 infected cells This reproduced a similar study done by Oba and colleagues in 2021Tanikawa T Kiba Y Yu J Hsu K Chen S Ishii A Yokogawa T Suzuki R Inoue Y Kitamura M Degradative Effect of

according to purity Kurosawa and colleagues have shown in humans that after a single oral dose of 2000 FU Ddimer concentrations at 6 and 8 hours and blood fibrinfibrinogen degradation products at 4 hours after administration elevated significantly p  005 respectively Thus an empiric starting dose could be 2000 FU twice a day Full pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies have not been completed but several years of market use as an overthecounter supplement suggests nattokinase is safe with the main caveat being excessive bleeding and cautions with concurrent antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugsBased on these findings nattokinase and similar products such as serrapeptase should undergo wellfunded accelerated preclinical and clinical development programs The issue at hand is the urgency of time similar to that with SARSCoV2 infection and empiric early therapy It will take up to 20 years to have a fully developed pharmaceutical profile to characterize the safety and efficacy of nattokinase in the treatment of vaccine injury and postCOVID syndromes Large number of people are sick now and many believe empiric treatment is justified given sufficiently low risk of side effects and potentially high reward My recommendation is to discuss this with your doctor or seek a specialist in holistic or naturopathic medicine who is experienced with the safety profile of

Internet Archive as your sourcePolitical Report of the Central CommitteeDecember 3IThe Growing Crisis of World Capitalism and the External Situation of the USSROur country comrades is living and developing in the conditions of capitalist encirclement Its external position depends not only on its internal forces but also on the state of that capitalist encirclement on the situation in the capitalist countries which surround our country on their strength and weakness on the strength and weakness of the oppressed classes throughout the world on the strength and weakness of the revolutionary movement of those classes That is apart from the fact that our revolution is a part of the international revolutionary movement of the oppressed classesThat is why I think that the Central Committees report must start with a sketch of our countrys international position with a sketch of the situation in the capitalist countries and of the state of the revolutionary movement in all countriesThe basic fact in this sphere comrades is that during the past two years during the period under review production in the capitalist countries has transcended the prewar level has gone beyond the prewar levelHere are some figures relating to thisIndex of world output of pig iron in 1925976 per cent of prewar in 1926already 1005 per cent of prewar for 1927 no complete figures are available figures are available for the first half year showing a further increase in the output of pig ironIndex of world output of steel in 19251185 per cent in 19261226 per cent of prewarIndex of world output of coal in 1925979 per cent in 1926a slight drop968 per cent This evidently reflects the effect of the British strikeWorld consumption of cotton in 1925261083 per cent of prewar in 1926271125 per cent of prewarWorld crop of five cereals 2 in 19251072 per cent of prewar in 19261105 per cent in 1927 1123 per centThus slowly in short steps the general index of world production is moving forward and has exceeded the prewar levelOn the other hand however some capitalist countries are not merely going forward but leaping forward leaving behind the prewar level for example the United States of America and in some respects Japan Figures for the United States growth of manufacturing industry in 1925148 per cent of prewar 1926152 per cent of prewar growth of mining industry in 1925 143 per cent of prewar 1926154 per centGrowth of world trade World trade is not advancing as rapidly as production it usually lags behind production but for all that it has approached the prewar level Index of foreign trade all over the world and in the chief countries in 1925981 per cent of prewar in 1926971 per cent For individual countries United States of America in 19251343 per cent of prewar in 1926143 per cent France982 per cent and 992 per cent Germany748 per cent and 736 per cent Japan1769 and 1701 per centTaken as a whole world trade has already approached the prewar level and in some countries the United States and Japan for example it has already exceeded the prewar levelLastly a third series of facts testifying to technical progress rationalisation of capitalist industry creation of new industries increasing trustification increasing cartellisation of industry on an international scale These facts I think are known to everybody Therefore I shall not dwell on them I shall merely observe that capital has prospered not only as regards the growth of production and as regards trade as well but also in the field of improving methods of production in the field of technical progress and the rationalisation of production moreover all this has led to the further strengthening of the largest trusts and to the organisation of new powerful monopolist cartelsSuch are the facts comrades that should be noted and that should serve as our startingpointDoes all this mean that thereby the stabilisation of capitalism has become firm and lasting Of course not It was already stated in the report to the Fourteenth Congress 3 that capitalism might reach the prewar level might exceed that prewar level might rationalise its production but that this did not meandid not by a long way meanthat the stabilisation of capitalism could as a result become firm that capitalism could recover its former prewar stability On the contrary this very stabilisation the fact that production is growing that trade is growing that technical progress and production potentialities are increasing whereas the world market the limits of that market and the spheres of influence of the individual imperialist groups remain more or less stableprecisely this is giving rise to a most profound and acute crisis of world capitalism a crisis which is fraught with new wars and which threatens the existence of any stabilisation at allPartial stabilisation is giving rise to an intensification of the crisis of capitalism and the growing crisis is upsetting stabilisationsuch are the dialectics of the development of capitalism in the present period of historyb The most characteristic feature of this growth of production and trade of world capitalism is that the development proceeds unevenly Development is not taking place in such a way that the capitalist countries are moving forward one behind the other smoothly and evenly without hindering one another and without upsetting each other but on the contrary in such a way that some countries are being ousted and are declining while others are pushing forward and moving upward it is proceeding in the form of a mortal struggle of continents and countries for supremacy in the marketThe economic centre is shifting from Europe to America from the Atlantic to the Pacific The share of world trade of America and Asia is thereby growing at the expense of EuropeA few figures in 1913 Europes share of world foreign trade was 585 per cent America s212 per cent and Asias123 per cent in 1925 however Europes share dropped to 50 per cent Americas share rose to 266 per cent and Asias share rose to 16 per cent Parallel with countries in which capitalism is tearing ahead the USA and partly Japan we have other countries which are in a state of economic decline Britain Parallel with growing capitalist Germany and rising countries which have been coming to the front in recent years Canada Australia Argentina China India we have countries in which capitalism is becoming stabilised France Italy The number of claimants to markets is growing production potentialities are growing and supply is growing but the dimensions of markets and the borders of spheres of influence remain more or less stableSuch is the basis of the growing irreconcilable contradictions of presentday capitalismc This contradiction between the growth of the production potentialities and the relative stability of markets lies at the root of the fact that the problem of markets is today the fundamental problem of capitalism An aggravation of the problem of markets in general especially an aggravation of the problem of foreign markets and an aggravation of the problem of markets for capital exports in particularsuch is the present state of capitalismThis indeed explains why it is becoming a common thing for mills and factories to work below capacity Raising tariff barriers only adds fuel to the flames Capitalism is becoming cramped in the framework of the present markets and spheres of influence Peaceful attempts to solve the problem of markets have not produced results nor could they do so As everybody knows the bankers declaration in 1926 about free trade ended in a fiasco 4 The Economic Conference of the League of Nations in 1927 the object of which was to unite the economic interests of the capitalist countries also ended in a fiasco The peaceful road to the solution of the problem of markets remains closed to capitalism The only way out left open for capitalism is a new redivision of colonies and of spheres of influence by force by means of armed collisions by means of new imperialist warsStabilisation is intensifying the crisis of capitalisma In this connection the question of redividing the world and spheres of influence which constitute the basis of foreign markets is today the principal question in the policy of world capitalism I have already said that the existing distribution of colonies and spheres of influence brought about as a result of the last imperialist war has already become obsolete It now fails to satisfy either the United States which not being content with South America is trying to penetrate Asia primarily China or Britain whose dominions and a number of whose most important Eastern markets are slipping from her hands or Japan which every now and again is obstructed in China by Britain and America or Italy and France which have an incalculable number of points of dispute in the Danubian countries and in the Mediterranean and least of all does it satisfy Germany which is still bereft of colonies Hence the general striving for a new redivision of markets and sources of raw materials That the Asiatic markets and the routes to them are the chief arena of the struggle needs no proof Hence a series of key problems which are hotbeds of new conflicts Hence the socalled Pacific problem the AmericaJapanBritain antagonism as the origin of the struggle for supremacy in Asia and on the routes to it Hence the Mediterranean problem the BritainFranceItaly antagonism as the origin of the struggle for supremacy on the shores of the Mediterranean as the origin of the struggle for the shortest routes to the East Hence the aggravation of the oil problem antagonism between Britain and America for without oil it is impossible to wage war and whoever has the advantage as regards oil has a chance of victory in the coming warRecently theBritish press published Chamberlains latest plan for settling the Mediterranean problem I cannot guarantee the authenticity of this plan but there can be no doubt that the appearance of Chamberlains plan in the press is symptomatic According to this plan the mandate for Syria is to be transferred from France to Italy Tangiers is to be transferred to France on the payment of financial compensation to Spain the Cameroons are to be restored to Germany Italy is to pledge herself to stop making trouble in the Balkans etcAll this is on the pretext of fighting the Soviets It is well known that no dirty work is undertaken nowadays without dragging in the SovietsBut what is the real intention of this plan Its intention is to oust the French bourgeoisie from Syria Since ancient times Syria has been the gate to the East to Mesopotamia Egypt etc From Syria it is possible to do harm to Britain both in the area of the Suez Canal and in the area of Mesopotamia And so apparently Chamberlain wants to put a stop to this unpleasant state of affairs Needless to say the appearance of this plan in the press cannot be called an accident The value of this fact is that it presents a vivid picture of the squabbles conflicts and military collisions which can arise from the present relations between the socalled great powersAs regards the present state of the oil problem and the struggle around it this is spoken of rather eloquently in the October issue of the wellknown American magazine The Worlds Work 5Herein lies a very real danger to peace and understanding between the AngloSaxon peoples    The support of American businessmen by the State Department will inevitably become stronger as the need for it increases If the British Government becomes identified with the British oil industry sooner or later the American Government will become identified with the American oil industry The struggle cannot be transferred to the governments without vastly increasing the danger of warThis leaves no room for doubt things are moving towards the organisation of new coalitions of powers in order to prepare new wars for foreign markets for sources of raw materials and for the routes to themb Have attempts been made during the period under review to bring about a peaceful settlement of the maturing military conflicts Yes there have been more of them than might have been expected but they have led to nothing absolutely nothing Not only that those attempts have turned out to be merely a screen for the preparations that the powers are making for new wars a screen intended to deceive the people to deceive public opinionTake the League of Nations which according to the mendacious bourgeois press and the no less mendacious SocialDemocratic press is an instrument of peace What has all the League of Nations talk about peace disarmament reduction of armaments led to To nothing except the deception of the masses except new spurts in armaments except a further aggravation of the maturing conflicts Can it be regarded as accidental that although the League of Nations has been talking about peace and disarmament for three years and although the socalled Second International has been giving its support to this mendacious talk for three years the nations are continuing to arm more and more expanding the old conflicts among the powers piling up new conflicts and thus undermining the cause of peaceWhat does the failure of the tripartite conference for the reduction of naval armaments Britain America and Japan 6 indicate if not that the Pacific problem is the source of new imperialist wars that the powers do not want either to disarm or to reduce armaments What has the League of Nations done to avert this dangerOr take for example the recent declarations of the Soviet delegation in Geneva on the question of genuine disarmament and not windowdressing7 What is the explanation of the fact that Comrade Litvinovs straightforward and honest declaration in favour of complete disarmament struck the League of Nations with paralysis and came as a complete surprise to it Does not this fact show that the League of Nations is not an instrument of peace and disarmament but an instrument for covering up new armaments and the preparation of new warsThe venal bourgeois press of all countries from Japan to Britain from France to America is shouting at the top of its voice that the Soviet disarmament proposals are insincere In that case why not test the sincerity of the Soviet proposals and proceed at once in practice to disarm or at least considerably to reduce armaments What prevents thisOr for example the present system of friendship pacts between capitalist states the pact between France and Yugoslavia the pact between Italy and Albania the pact of friendship between Poland and Lithuania that Pilsudski is preparing the Locarno system 8 the spirit of Locarno etcwhat is this if not a system of preparation of new wars and of alignment of forces for future military collisionsOr take for example the following facts from 1913 to 1927 the numerical strength of the armies of France Britain Italy the United States and Japan increased from 1888000 to 2262000 men in the same period the military budgets of the same countries grew from 2345 million gold rubles to 3948 million in the period from 1923 to 1927 the number of aircraft in commission in these five countries rose from 2655 to 4340 the cruiser tonnage of these five powers rose from 724000 tons in 1922 to 864000 tons in 1926 the position as regards war chemicals is illustrated by the wellknown statement of General Fries Chief of the United States Chemical Warfare Service One chemical airbomb of 450 kilograms charged with Lewisite can make ten blocks of New York uninhabitable and 100 tons of Lewisite dropped from 50 aeroplanes can make the whole of New York uninhabitable at least for a weekWhat do these facts show if not that the preparation of a new war is in full swingSuch are the results of the peace policy and of the disarmament policy of the bourgeois states in general of the League of Nations especially and of SocialDemocratic servility to capital in particularFormerly the justification put forward for the growth of armaments was that Germany was armed from head to foot Today this justification falls to the ground because Germany has been disarmedIs it not obvious that the growth of armaments is dictated by the inevitability of new imperialist wars between the powers that the spirit of war is the principal content of the spirit of LocarnoI think that the present peaceful relations could be likened to an old wornout shirt consisting of patches held together by a thin thread It is enough to pull this thread fairly hard to break it in some place or other for the whole shirt to fall to pieces leaving nothing but patches It is enough to shake the present peaceful relations somewhere in Albania or Lithuania in China or North Africa for the whole edifice of peaceful relations to collapseThat is how things were before the last imperialist war when the assassination in Sarajevo 9 led to warThat is how things are nowStabilisation is inevitably giving rise to new imperialist warsa For waging war increased armaments are not enough the organisation of new coalitions is not enough For this it is necessary in addition to strengthen the rear in the capitalist countries Not a single capitalist country can wage an important war unless it first strengthens its own rear unless it curbs its workers unless it curbs its colonies Hence the gradual fascisation of the policy of the bourgeois governmentsThe fact that the Right bloc now rules in France the HicksDeterdingUrquhart bloc in Britain the bourgeois bloc in Germany the war party in Japan and fascist governments in Italy and Poland cannot be called accidentalHence the pressure that is being brought to bear upon the working class the TradeUnion Act in Britain 10 the law on arming the nation in France 11 the abolition of the eighthour day in a number of countries and the offensive of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat everywhereHence the increased pressure that is being brought to bear upon the colonies and dependent countries the reinforcement there of imperialist troops whose number has now reached a million of which over 700000 are quartered in the British spheres of influence and possessionsb It is not difficult to understand that this brutal pressure of the fascisised governments was bound to meet with a countermovement on the part of the oppressed peoples in the colonies and of the working class in the metropolises Facts like the growth of the revolutionary movement in China Indonesia India etc cannot fail to have a decisive significance for the fate of world imperialismJudge for yourselves Of the 1905 million inhabitants of the entire globe 1134 million live in the colonies and dependent countries 143000000 live in the USSR 264000000 live in the intermediate countries and only 363000000 live in the big imperialist countries which oppress the colonies and dependent countriesClearly the revolutionary awakening of the colonial and dependent countries presages the end of world imperialism The fact that the Chinese revolution has not yet led to direct victory over imperialism cannot be of decisive significance for the prospects of the revolution Great popular revolutions never achieve final victory in the first round of their battles They grow and gain strength in the course of flows and ebbs That has been so everywhere including Russia So it will be in ChinaThe most important result of the Chinese revolution is the fact that it has awakened from agelong slumber and has set in motion hundreds of millions of exploited and oppressed people has utterly exposed the counterrevolutionary character of the cliques of generals has torn the mask from the faces of the Kuomintang servitors of counterrevolution has raised the prestige of the Communist Party among the masses of the common people has raised the movement as a whole to a higher stage and has roused new hope in the hearts of the millions of the oppressed classes in India Indonesia etc Only the blind and the fainthearted can doubt that the Chinese workers and peasants are moving towards a new revolutionary upsurgeAs regards the revolutionary workingclass movement in Europe here in this sphere too we have obvious signs of a swing to the Left on the part of the rankandfile workers and of a revolutionary revival Facts like the British general strike and coal strike the revolutionary action of the workers in Vienna the revolutionary demonstrations in France and Germany in connection with the murder of Sacco and Vanzetti the election successes achieved by the German and Polish Communist Parties the obvious differentiation that is taking place in the British workingclass movement whereby the workers are moving to the Left while the leaders are moving to the Right into the camp of avowed socialimperialism the degeneration of the Second International into a direct appendage of the imperialist League of Nations the decline of the prestige of the SocialDemocratic parties among the broad masses of the working class the universal growth of the influence and prestige of the Comintern and its sections among the proletarians in all countries the growth of the prestige of the USSR among the oppressed classes all over the world the Congress of the Friends of the USSR 12 etcall these facts undoubtedly indicate that Europe is entering a new period of revolutionary upsurgeIf a fact like the murder of Sacco and Vanzetti could give rise to workingclass demonstrations it undoubtedly indicates that revolutionary energy has accumulated in the depths of the working class and is seeking and will continue to seek a cause an occasion sometimes seemingly most insignificant to break to the surface and hurl itself upon the capitalist regimeWe are living on the eve of a new revolutionary upsurge both in the colonies and in the metropolisesStabilisation is giving rise to a new revolutionary upsurgea Thus we have all the symptoms of a most profound crisis and of the growing instability of world capitalismWhereas the temporary postwar economic crisis of 192021 with the chaos within the capitalist countries and the breakdown of their external ties may be regarded as having been overcome as a result of which a period of partial stabilisation has begun the general and fundamental crisis of capitalism ushered in as a result of the victory of the October Revolution and the dropping out of the USSR from the world capitalist system far from being overcome is on the contrary becoming deeper and deeper and is shaking the very foundations of the existence of world capitalismFar from hindering the development of this general and fundamental crisis stabilisation on the contrary has provided the basis and source for its further development The growing struggle for markets the necessity of a new redivision of the world and of spheres of influence the bankruptcy of bourgeois pacifism and of the League of Nations the feverish efforts to form new coalitions and to align forces in view of the possibility of a new war the furious growth of armaments the savage pressure upon the working class and the colonial countries the growth of the revolutionary movement in the colonies and in Europe the growth of the prestige of the Comintern throughout the world and lastly the consolidation of the might of the Soviet Union and its enhanced prestige among the workers of Europe and the labouring masses in the coloniesall these are facts which cannot but shake the very foundations of world capitalismThe stabilisation of capitalism is becoming more and more putrid and unstableWhereas a couple of years ago it was possible and necessary to speak of the ebb of the revolutionary tide in Europe today we have every ground for asserting that Europe is obviously entering a period of new revolutionary upsurge to say nothing of the colonies and dependent countries where the position of the imperialists is becoming more and more catastrophicb The capitalists hopes of taming the USSR of its capitalistic degeneration of the decline of its prestige among the workers of Europe and the labouring masses of the colonies have collapsed The USSR is growing and developing precisely as a country which is building socialism Its influence among the workers and peasants all over the world is growing and gaining strength The very existence of the USSR as a country which is building socialism is one of the greatest factors in the disintegration of world imperialism and in the undermining of its stability both in Europe and in the colonies The USSR is obviously becoming the banner of the working class of Europe and of the oppressed peoples of the coloniesTherefore to clear the ground for future imperialist wars to secure a tighter grip on their working class and to curb their colonies with the object of strengthening the capitalist rear it is necessary the bourgeois bosses think first of all to curb the USSR that seat and hotbed of revolution which moreover could be one of the biggest markets for the capitalist countries Hence the revival of interventionist tendencies among the imperialists the policy of isolating the USSR the policy of encircling the USSR the policy of preparing the conditions for war against the USSRThe strengthening of interventionist tendencies in the camp of the imperialists and the threat of war against the USSR is one of the basic factors in the present situationIt is considered that the most threatened and injured party under the conditions of the developing crisis of capitalism is the British bourgeoisie And it is the British bourgeoisie that has taken the initiative in strengthening interventionist tendencies Obviously the assistance that the Soviet workers rendered the British coal miners and the sympathy of the working class of the USSR for the revolutionary movement in China could not but add fuel to the flames All these circumstances determined Britains rupture with the USSR and the worsening of relations with a number of other statesc The struggle between two tendencies in the relations between the capitalist world and the USSR the tendency towards military aggression primarily Britain and the tendency to continue peaceful relations a number of other capitalist countries is in view of this the basic fact in our foreign relations at the present timeFacts which denote the tendency towards peaceful relations during the period under review are the NonAggression Pact with Turkey the Guarantee Pact with Germany the Tariff Agreement with Greece the agreement with Germany on credits the Guarantee Pact with Afghanistan the Guarantee Pact with Lithuania the initialling of a Guarantee Pact with Latvia the Trade Agreement with Turkey the settlement of the conflict with Switzerland the Treaty of Neutrality with Persia improvement in relations with Japan growth of commercial intercourse with America and ItalyFacts which denote the tendency towards military aggression during the period under review are the British Note in connection with financial assistance to the striking coal miners the raid on the Soviet diplomatic representatives in Peking Tientsin and Shanghai the raid on Arcos Britains rupture with the USSR the assassination of Voikov terroristic acts by British hirelings in the USSR strained relations with France on the question of the recall of RakovskyWhereas a year or two ago it was possible and necessary to speak of a period of a certain equilibrium and peaceful coexistence between the USSR and the capitalist countries today we have every ground for asserting that the period of peaceful coexistence is receding into the past giving place to a period of imperialist assaults and preparation for intervention against the USSRTrue Britains attempts to form a united front against the USSR have failed so far The reasons for this failure are the contradiction of interests in the camp of the imperialists the fact that some countries are interested in economic relations with the USSR the peace policy of the USSR the counteraction of the working class of Europe the imperialists fear of unleashing revolution in their own countries in the event of war against the USSR But this does not mean that Britain will abandon her efforts to organise a united front against the USSR that she will fail to organise such a front The threat of war remains in force despite Britains temporary setbacksHence the task is to take into account the contradictions in the camp of the imperialists to postpone war by buying off the capitalists and to take all measures to maintain peaceful relationsWe must not forget Lenins statement that as regards our work of construction very much depends upon whether we succeed in postponing war with the capitalist world which is inevitable but which can be postponed either until the moment when the proletarian revolution in Europe matures or until the moment when the colonial revolutions have fully matured or lastly until the moment when the capitalists come to blows over the division of the coloniesTherefore the maintenance of peaceful relations with the capitalist countries is an obligatory task for usOur relations with the capitalist countries are based on the assumption that the coexistence of two opposite systems is possible Practice has fully confirmed this Sometimes the question of debts and credits is a stumblingblock In this our policy is clear It is based on the formula give and take If you give us credits with which to fertilise our industry you will get some part of the prewar debts which we regard as extra interest on the credits If you give nothing you will get nothing Facts show that we have some achievements to record as regards receiving industrial credits I have in mind just now not only Germany but also America and Britain Wherein lies the secret In the fact that our country could be a vast market for imports of equipment while the capitalist countries need markets for precisely that kind of goodsTo sum up we haveFirstly the growth of the contradictions within the capitalist encirclement the necessity for capitalism of a new redivision of the world by means of war the interventionist tendencies of one part of the capitalist world headed by Britain the reluctance of the other part of the capitalist world to become involved in war against the USSR preferring to establish economic relations with it a conflict between these two tendencies and a certain possibility for the USSR to turn these contradictions to account for the purpose of maintaining peaceSecondly we have the collapsing stabilisation the growth of the colonialrevolutionary movement the signs of a new revolutionary upsurge in Europe the growth of the prestige of the Comintern and its sections throughout the world the obvious growth of the sympathy of the working class of Europe for the USSR the growing might of the USSR and the growing prestige of the working class of our country among the oppressed classes throughout the worldHence the Partys tasks1 In the sphere of the international revolutionary movementa to strive to develop the Communist Parties throughout the worldb to strive to strengthen the revolutionary trade unions and the workers united front against the capitalist offensivec to strive to strengthen the friendship between the working class of the USSR and the working class in the capitalist countriesd to strive to strengthen the link between the working class of the USSR and the liberation movement in the colonies and dependent countries2 In the sphere of the USSRs foreign policya to combat the preparations for new imperialist warsb to combat Britains interventionist tendencies and to strive to strengthen the USSR s defensive capacityc to pursue a policy of peace and to maintain peaceful relations with the capitalist countriesd to expand our trade with the outside world on the basis of strengthening the monopoly of foreign tradee rapprochement with the socalled weak and unequal states which are suffering from oppression and exploitation by the ruling imperialist powersIIThe Successes of Socialist Construction and the Internal Situation in the USSRPermit me comrades to pass to the internal situation in our country to the successes of our socialist construction to the question of the fate of the dictatorship of the proletariat of its development of its consolidationThe Fourteenth Congress of our Party instructed the Central Committee to direct the development of our national economy from the standpoint of the following principal tasksfirstly that our policy should promote the progressive growth of production in the national economy as a wholesecondly that the Partys policy should promote the acceleration of the rate of development of industry and ensure for industry the leading role in the whole of the national economythirdly that in the course of development of the national economy the socialist sector of the national economy the socialist forms of economy should be ensured everincreasing relative importance at the expense of the privatecommodity and capitalist sectorsfourthly that our economic development as a whole the organisation of new branches of industry the development of certain branches for raw materials etc should be conducted along such lines that the general development should ensure the economic independence of our country that our country should not become an appendage of the capitalist system of world economyfifthly that the dictatorship of the proletariat the bloc of the working class and the peasant masses and the leadership by the working class in this bloc should be strengthened andsixthly that the material and cultural conditions of the working class and of the rural poor should be steadily improvedWhat has our Party the Central Committee of our Party done in regard to carrying out these tasks during the period under reviewFirst questiondevelopment of the national economy as a whole I shall quote here some of the principal figures showing the growth of the national economy as a whole and of industry and agriculture in particular during the period under review I take these figures from the estimates of the State Planning Commission I have in mind the State Planning Commissions control figures for 192728 and the rough draft of the fiveyear plana Growth of production in the whole of the national economy of the USSR during the two years Whereas in 192425 according to the State Planning Commissions new calculations the gross output of agriculture amounted to 873 per cent of the prewar level and the output of industry as a whole amounted to 637 per cent of the prewar level now two years later in 192627 agricultural output already amounts to 1083 per cent and industrial output to 1009 per cent According to the State Planning Commissions control figures for 192728 a further increase in agricultural output to 1118 per cent of prewar and of industrial output to 1144 per cent of prewar is anticipatedThe growth of trade turnover wholesale and retail in the country during the two years Taking the volume of trade in 192425 at 100 14613 million chervonets rubles we have an increase in 192627 by 97 per cent 28775 million rubles and in 192728 a further growth to over 116 per cent of the previous year 33440 million rubles is anticipatedThe development of our credit system during the two years Taking the combined balancesheets of all our credit institutions on October 1 1925 at 100 5343 million chervonets rubles we have an increase on July 1 1927 by 53 per cent 8175 million rubles There are no grounds for doubting that 192728 will show a further growth of our nationalised credit systemThe development of railway transport during the two years Whereas the freight turnover of the whole of our railway system in 192425 amounted to 631 per cent of prewar now in 192627 it amounts to 991 per cent and in 192728 it will amount to 1116 per cent That is apart from the fact that during these two years the total length of our railways increased from 74400 kilometres to 76200 kilometres which is an increase of 303 per cent above the prewar level and of 89 per cent above the level of 1917The growth of the state budget during the two years Whereas our combined budget the single state budget plus the local budgets in 192526 amounted to 724 per cent of prewar 5024 million rubles at the present time ie 192728 the combined budget should amount to 110112 per cent of prewar over 7000 million rubles The increase during the two years is 415 per centThe growth of foreign trade during the two years Whereas our total foreign trade turnover in 192425 amounted to 1282 million rubles ie about 27 per cent of prewar now in 192627 we have a turnover of 1483 million rubles ie 356 per cent of prewar and it is anticipated that in 192728 we shall have a turnover of 1626 million rubles ie 379 per cent of prewarThe causes of the slow rate of development of foreign tradefirstly the fact that the bourgeois states often place obstacles in the way of our foreign trade which sometimes amount to a secret blockadesecondly the fact that we cannot trade according to the bourgeois formula we shall export even if we go short of foodA good feature is the favourable balance of the Peoples Commissariat of Foreign Trade in 192627 amounting to 57 million rubles This is the first year since 192324 that we have had a favourable balance of foreign tradeSumming up we have the following picture of the general growth of the total national income during the two years whereas the national income of the USSR in 192425 amounted to 15589 million chervonets rubles in 192526 we had 20252 million rubles ie an increase for the year of 299 per cent and in 192627 we had 22560 million rubles ie an increase of 114 per cent for the year According to the State Planning Commissions control figures in 192728 we shall have 24208 million rubles ie an increase of 73 per centBearing in mind that the average annual increase in the national income of the United States does not exceed 34 per cent only once in the eighties of the last century did the United States have an increase in national income of about 7 per cent and that the annual increase in the national income of other countries Britain and Germany for example does not exceed 13 per cent it must be admitted that the rate of growth of the national income of the USSR during the last few years is a record one compared with that of the major capitalist countries of Europe and AmericaConclusion the national economy of our country is growing at a rapid rateThe Partys task further to promote the development of our countrys national economy in all branches of productionb The growth of our national economy is proceeding not blindly not along the line of a simple quantitative increase in production but in a known strictly defined direction The decisive factors in the development of the national economy during the past two years have been the following two principal circumstancesFirstly the keynote of the development of our national economy is the industrialisation of the country the increasingly important role of industry in relation to agricultureSecondly the development of the national economy the industrialisation of the country is proceeding in the direction of an increase in the relative importance and commanding role of the socialist forms of economy in both production and trade at the expense of the privatecommodity and capitalist sectorsFigures showing the increase of the relative importance of industry in the national economy exclusive of transport and electrification Whereas in 192425 industrys share of the gross output of the national economy calculated at prewar prices amounted to 324 per cent and the share of agriculture to 676 per cent in 192627 industrys share rose to 38 per cent while the share of agriculture dropped to 62 per cent In 192728 industrys share should rise to 402 and that of agriculture should drop to 598 per centFigures showing the increase in the relative importance of the production of instruments and means of production  which is the chief core of industry as compared with the whole of industry during the two years in 192425 the share of production of means of production341 per cent in 192627376 per cent in 192728 it is proposed to bring it up to 386 per centFigures showing the increase of the relative importance of the production of means of production in state largescale industry during the two years in 192425 420 per cent in 192627440 per cent in 192728 it is proposed to bring it up to 449 per centAs regards industrys output of commodities and the relative importance of this output in the total volume of commodities industrys share in the two years rose from 531 per cent in 192425 to 595 per cent in 192627 and in 192728 it should reach 607 per cent whereas agricultures share of the output of commodities amounted to 469 per cent in 192425 dropped to 405 per cent in 192627 and in 192728 should drop further to 393 per centConclusion our country is becoming an industrial countryThe Partys task to take all measures further to promote the industrialisation of our countryFigures showing the growth of the relative importance and commanding role of the socialist forms of economy at the expense of the privatecommodity and capitalist sectors during the two years Whereas capital investments in the socialised sector of the national economy state and cooperative industry transport electrification etc increased from 1231 million rubles in 192425 to 2683 million rubles in 192627 and in 192728 should rise to 3456 million rubles which amounts to an increase from 438 per cent of total investments in 192425 to 653 per cent in 192728investments in the nonsocialised sector of the national economy have been relatively decreasing all the time and in absolute figures have increased only slightly from 1577 million rubles in 192425 to 1717 million rubles in 192627 and in 192728 should reach the figure of 1836 million rubles which will be a fall in the relative importance of investments in the nonsocialised sector from 562 per cent in 192425 to 347 per cent in 192728Whereas the gross output of the socialised sector of industry rose from 81 per cent in 192425 to 86 per cent of the total industrial output in 192627 and in 192728 should rise to 869 per cent the share of the nonsocialised sector of industry has been falling year by year from 19 per cent of the total industrial output in 192425 to 14 per cent in 192627 and in 192728 it should fall still further to 131 per centAs regards the part played by private capital in largescale statistically registered industry it is falling not only relatively 39 per cent in 192425 and 24 per cent in 192627 but also absolutely 169 million prewar rubles in 192425 and 165 million prewar rubles in 192627The same ousting of private capitalist elements is seen in the sphere of home trade Whereas in 192425 the socialised sectors share of the total trade turnover wholesale and retail amounted to 726 per cent wholesale 906 per cent and retail 573 per cent in 192627 the socialised sectors share of total trade rose to 819 per centwholesale to 949 per cent and retail to 674 per cent On the other hand the private sectors share dropped in this period from 274 per cent of total trade to 181 per centwholesale from 94 per cent to 51 per cent and retail from 427 per cent to 326 per cent and in 192728 a further drop in the private sectors share in all branches of trade is anticipatedConclusion our country is confidently and rapidly proceeding towards socialism pushing the capitalist elements into the background and step by step ousting them from the national economyThis fact reveals to us the basis of the question Who will beat whom This question was raised by Lenin in 1921 after the New Economic Policy was introduced Shall we succeed in linking our socialised industry with peasant economy ousting the private trader the private capitalist and learning to trade or will private capital beat us by causing a split between the proletariat and the peasantrythat is how the question stood at that time Now we can say that in the main we have already achieved decisive successes in this sphere Only the blind or the imbecile can deny thatNow however the question Who will beat whom assumes a different character This question is now shifting from the sphere of trade to the sphere of production to the sphere of handicraft production to the sphere of agricultural production where private capital is of a certain importance and from which it must be systematically eliminatedThe Partys task to extend and consolidate our socialist key positions in all branches of the national economy both in town and country pursuing a course towards the elimination of the capitalist elements from the national economya The growth of the output of largescale nationalised industry which constitutes over 77 per cent of all industry in the country Whereas in 192526 the increase in output calculated in prewar rubles of largescale nationalised industry over that of the preceding year amounted to 422 per cent in 192627 to 182 per cent and in 192728 will amount to 158 per cent the State Planning Commissions rough and very conservative fiveyear estimates provide for an increase in output during five years of 767 per cent with an average arithmetical annual increase of 15 per cent and an increase in industrial output in 193132 to double the prewar outputIf we take the gross output of all industry in the country both largescale state and private and small industry then the annual average arithmetical increase in output according to the State Planning Commissions fiveyear estimates will be about 12 per cent which will be an increase in total industrial output in 193132 of nearly 70 per cent compared with the prewar levelIn America the annual increase in total industrial output for the five years 189095 was 82 per cent for the five years 1895190052 per cent for the five years 19000526 per cent for the five years 19051036 per cent In Russia for the ten years 18951905 the average annual increase was 107 per cent for the eight years 19051381 per centThe percentage of annual increase in the output of our socialist industry and also in the output of all industry is a record one such as not a single big capitalist country in the world can showAnd that is in spite of the fact that American industry and especially Russian prewar industry were abundantly fertilised by a powerful flow of foreign capital whereas our nationalised industry is compelled to base itself on its own accumulationsAnd that is in spite of the fact that our nationalised industry has already entered the period of reconstruction when the reequipment of old factories and the erection of new ones has acquired decisive importance for increasing industrial outputIn the rate of its development our industry in general and our socialist industry in particular is overtaking and outstripping the development of industry in the capitalist countriesb How is this unprecedented rate of development of our largescale industry to be explainedFirstly by the fact that it is nationalised industry thanks to which it is free from the selfish and antisocial interests of private capitalist groups and is able to develop in conformity with the interests of society as a wholeSecondly by the fact that it is conducted on a larger scale and is more concentrated than industry anywhere else in the world thanks to which it has every possibility of beating private capitalist industryThirdly by the fact that the state controlling nationalised transport nationalised credit nationalised foreign trade and the general state budget has every possibility of directing nationalised industry in a planned way as a single industrial enterprise which gives it enormous advantages over all other industry and accelerates its rate of development many times overFourthly by the fact that nationalised industry being industry of the biggest and most powerful kind has every possibility of pursuing a policy of steadily reducing production costs of reducing wholesale prices and cheapening its products thereby expanding the market for its products increasing the capacity of the home market and creating for itself a continuously increasing source for the further expansion of productionFifthly by the fact that nationalised industry is able for many reasons one of them being that it pursues the policy of reducing prices to develop under conditions of gradual rapprochement between town and country between the proletariat and the peasantry in contrast with capitalist industry which develops under conditions of increasing enmity between the bourgeois town which bleeds the peasantry white and the decaying countrysideLastly by the fact that nationalised industry is based on the working class which is the leader in all our development thanks to which it is able more easily to develop technology in general and the productivity of labour in particular and to apply rationalisation to production and management with the support of the broad masses of the working class which is not and cannot be the case under the capitalist system of industryAll this is proved beyond doubt by the rapid growth of our technology during the past two years and the rapid development of new branches of industry machines machinetools turbines automobiles and aircraft chemicals etcIt is also proved by the rationalisation of production that we are carrying out along with a shorter working day a 7hour day and along with a steady improvement in the material and cultural conditions of the working class which is not and cannot be the case under the capitalist system of economyThe unprecedented rate of development of our socialist industry is direct and indubitable proof of the superiority of the Soviet system of production over the capitalist systemLenin was right in saying as far back as September 1917 before the Bolsheviks had captured power that after establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat we can and must overtake and outstrip the advanced countries economically as well Vol XXI p 191The Partys task to maintain the achieved rate of development of socialist industry and to increase it in the near future with the object of creating the favourable conditions necessary for overtaking and outstripping the advanced capitalist countriesa In the countryside on the other hand we have a relatively slow growth of output Whereas in 192526 the increase in gross output calculated in prewar rubles compared with the preceding year amounted to 192 per cent in 192627 to 41 per cent and in 192728 will amount to 32 per cent the State Planning Commissions rough and very conservative fiveyear estimates provide for an increase in output during five years of 24 per cent with an average arithmetical annual increase in output of 48 per cent and with an increase in agricultural output in 193132 of 2830 per cent compared with prewar outputThis is a more or less tolerable annual increase in agricultural output But it cannot possibly be called either a record one compared with the capitalist countries or an adequate one for maintaining in the future the necessary equilibrium between agriculture and our nationalised industryIn the USA the annual increase in the gross output of agriculture was 93 per cent in the decade 18901900 31 per cent in the decade 190010 and 14 per cent in the decade 191020 In prewar Russia the annual increase in agricultural output in the decade 190011 was 3235 per centTrue the annual increase in the output of our agriculture in the fiveyear period 192627193132 will amount to 48 per cent moreover as is seen the percentage increase in agricultural output under Soviet conditions has grown compared with that in the period of capitalist Russia But it must not be forgotten that whereas the gross output of nationalised industry in 193132 will be double that of prewar industry and the output of all industry in 193132 will show an increase of about 70 per cent above the prewar level the output of agriculture by that time will exceed the prewar agricultural output only by 2830 per cent ie by less than a thirdIn view of this the rate of development of our agriculture cannot be regarded as quite satisfactoryb How is this relatively slow rate of development of agriculture compared with the rate of development of our nationalised industry to be explainedIt is due to the extreme backwardness of our agricultural technique and the exceedingly low cultural level in the countryside and particularly to the fact that our scattered agricultural production does not have the advantages that our largescale united nationalised industry has First of all agricultural production is not nationalised and not united but broken up and scattered It is not carried on in a planned way and for the time being an enormous part of it is subjected to the anarchy of small production It is not united and organised in large units on the lines of collective farming and for that reason still provides a convenient field for exploitation by kulak elements These circumstances deprive scattered agriculture of the colossal advantages of largescale united and planned production which our nationalised industry possessesWhat is the way out for agriculture Perhaps the slowing down of the rate of development of our industry in general and of our nationalised industry in particular Under no circumstances That would be most reactionary antiproletarian utopianism Voices  Quite right Nationalised industry must and will develop at an accelerated rate That is the guarantee of our advance to socialism That is the guarantee that finally agriculture itself will be industrialisedWhat is the way out The way out is to turn the small and scattered peasant farms into large united farms based on cultivation of the land in common to go over to collective cultivation of the land on the basis of a new and higher techniqueThe way out is to unite the small and dwarf peasant farms gradually but surely not by pressure but by example and persuasion into large farms based on common cooperative collective cultivation of the land with the use of agricultural machines and tractors and scientific methods of intensive agricultureThere is no other way outUnless this is done our agriculture will be unable either to overtake or to outstrip the capitalist countries with the most developed agriculture Canada etcAll the measures we have taken to restrict the capitalist elements in agriculture to develop the socialist elements in the countryside to draw the peasant farms into the channel of cooperative development to exercise planned influence by the state on the countryside by embracing peasant economy both as regards supplies and marketing and as regards productionall these measures are decisive it is true but for all that they are only preparatory to putting agriculture on to a collectivist basisc What has the Party done in this direction during the two years Not a little has been done but it is far from all that could have been doneAs regards embracing agriculture from outside so to speak along the line of supplying agriculture with the manufactured goods it needs and the marketing of agricultural produce we have the following achievements the agricultural cooperatives now unite about a third of all peasant households the consumers cooperatives have increased their share of supplies to the countryside from 256 per cent in 192425 to 508 per cent in 192627 the cooperative and state bodies have increased their share of the marketing of agricultural produce from 557 per cent in 192425 to 63 per cent in 192627As regards embracing agriculture from inside so to speak along the line of agricultural production terribly little has been done Suffice it to say that at the present time the collective farms and state farms provide only a little over 2 per cent of the total agricultural produce and a little over 7 per cent of the total marketed produceThere are quite a few reasons for this of course both objective and subjective Unskilful approach to the matter insufficient attention to it on the part of our officials the conservatism and backwardness of the peasants the shortage of funds necessary for financing the passing over of the peasants to the common cultivation of the land etc And quite large funds are needed for this purposeLenin said at the Tenth Congress that we still lacked the funds necessary for making agriculture subject to the state or collective principle I think that now we shall have those funds and they ought to increase in the course of time But meanwhile things are taking such a turn that unless the scattered peasant farms are united unless they go over to cultivation of the land in common it will be impossible to make serious progress either in the intensification or in the mechanisation of agriculture it will be impossible to arrange things in such a way that the rate of development of our agriculture can exceed that of capitalist countries such as Canada for exampleTherefore the task is to concentrate the attention of our officials in the countryside on this important matterI think that in this matter the machinehiring stations under the Peoples Commissariats of Agriculture and of the agricultural cooperatives must play an exceedingly important roleHere is an example how the state farms sometimes help the peasants to go over to collective cultivation of the land with enormous benefit to the peasants I have in mind the assistance in the way of tractors which the Association of Ukrainian State Farms rendered the peasants in the Odessa District and the letter from those peasants recently published in Izvestia expressing thanks for this assistance Permit me to read this letter Voices  Please doWe settlers in the hamlets of Shevchenko Krasin Kalinin Red Dawn and Rising Sun express our profound gratitude to the Soviet Government for the enormous assistance afforded us in restoring our farms The majority of usbeing poor possessing neither horses nor implementswere unable to cultivate the land allotted to us and were obliged to lease it to the longresident kulaks receiving part of the crop in return The crop was a bad one because naturally a tenant will not trouble to cultivate properly other peoples land The small credits we received from the state we used up for food and we sank into deeper poverty every yearThis year a representative of the Association of Ukrainian State Farms visited us and proposed to us that instead of taking financial credits we should allow our land to be ploughed with tractors All the settlers except for a few kulaks agreed to this although we had little confidence that the work would be done efficiently To our great joy and to the chagrin of the kulaks the tractors ploughed up all the virgin land and fallow land they ploughed and harrowed 56 times to clear the land of weeds and finally sowed all the fields with highgrade wheat The kulaks are not jeering at the work of the tractor team now This year owing to the absence of rain the peasants in our district planted hardly any winter wheat and where it was planted it has not come up yet But our settlers fields stretching for hundreds of dessiatins are green with splendid fallowsown wheat such as cannot be seen even in the richest German settlementsIn addition to sowing winter wheat the tractors ploughed up the whole of the winter fallow for the spring crops Now not a dessiatin of our land has been left unploughed or leased out There is not a single poor peasant among us who has not several dessiatins of winter wheatAfter we have seen the way the tractors work we do not want to carry on poor small farming any more and we have decided to organise common tractor farming in which there will be no separate peasant plots The organisation of tractor farming for us has already been undertaken by the Taras Shevchenko State Farm with which we have signed a contract Izvestia No 267 November 22 1927That is what the peasants writeIf we had more examples like this comrades it would be possible to make great progress in the collectivisation of the countrysideThe Partys task to enlarge the extent of peasant economy embraced by the cooperatives and state bodies in the matter of marketing and supplies and to make it the immediate practical task of our work in the countryside gradually to transform the scattered peasant farms into united big farms to introduce collective cultivation of the land on the basis of the intensification and mechanisation of agriculture calculating that such a path of development is a most important means of accelerating the rate of development of agriculture and of defeating the capitalist elements in the countrysideSuch on the whole are the results and achievements in the sphere of the work of economic constructionThis does not mean that all is well with us in this sphere No comrades by no means everything is well with usFor example we have elements of a goods shortage That is an unfavourable feature in our economy but unfortunately for the time being an inevitable one For the fact that we are developing the production of instruments and means of production at a faster rate than light industry this fact in itself predetermines that there will still be elements of a goods shortage in the country during the next few years But we cannot act otherwise if we want to push forward the industrialisation of the country to the utmostThere are people our opposition for example who draw material for their ideology in profiteers queues and shout about the goods shortage and at the same time demand a policy of superindustrialisation But that of course is stupid comrades Only ignoramuses can talk like that We cannot we must not cut down our heavy industry for the sake of developing light industry to the utmost And besides it is impossible to develop light industry to a sufficient extent unless the development of heavy industry is acceleratedWe could have increased imports of finished goods and thus have mitigated the goods shortage and that is what the opposition insisted on at one time But that proposal was so silly that the opposition had to drop it Whether we are working efficiently enough to mitigate the elements of the goods shortage which it is quite possible to do under our conditions and on which our Party has always insisted is another question I think that it is precisely in this sphere that not all is well with usFurther we have a fact like the relatively large number of capitalists both in the sphere of industry and in the sphere of trade The relative importance of these elements is really not quite so small as some of our comrades sometimes depict it That too is a liability in the balancesheet of our economyRecently I read what is in every respect an interesting book by Comrade Larin Private Capital in the USSR I would advise you to read this book comrades In it you will see how adroitly and skilfully the capitalist hides himself behind the flag of producers cooperation behind the flag of agricultural cooperation behind the flag of state trading bodies of one kind or other Is everything being done to restrict reduce and finally to oust the capitalist elements from the sphere of our national economy I do not think that everything is being done I know for example that in handicraft industry in general and in the leather and textile industries in particular there are quite a number of new millionaires who are enslaving the handicraft workers and small producers generally Is everything being done economically to surround and oust these exploiting elements by linking the handicraft workers with the cooperatives or with state bodies There can scarcely be any doubt that far from everything is being done in this sphere And yet this question is of extreme importance for usFurther there has been a certain increase in the number of kulaks in the countryside That is a liability in the balancesheet of our economy Is everything being done economically to restrict and isolate the kulaks I do not think that everything is being done Those comrades are wrong who think that it is possible and necessary to put an end to the kulaks by means of administrative measures through the GPU give an order affix a seal and that settles it That is an easy way but it is far from being effective The kulak must be defeated by means of economic measures and in conformity with Soviet law Soviet law however is not a mere phrase This does not of course preclude the taking of certain necessary administrative measures against the kulaks But administrative measures must not take the place of economic measures Serious attention must be paid to the fact that the Partys line in the fight against the kulaks is being distorted in the practice of our cooperative bodies especially in the matter of agricultural creditsFurther we have a fact like the extremely slow rate of reduction of production costs in industry of reduction of wholesale prices of manufactured goods and especially of retail prices of urban goods This too is a liability in the balancesheet of our work of economic construction We cannot but observe that in this we encounter the tremendous resistance of the apparatus state cooperative and Party Evidently our comrades fail to understand that the policy of reducing the prices of manufactured goods is one of the principal levers for improving our industry expanding the market and strengthening the very basis on which alone our industry can expand There can scarcely be any doubt that only by ruthlessly combating this inertia of the apparatus this resistance of the apparatus to the policy of reducing prices will it be possible to wipe out this liabilityLastly we have liabilities like vodka in the budget the extremely slow rate of development of foreign trade and the shortage of reserves I think that it would be possible to start gradually to reduce the output of vodka and instead of vodka to resort to sources of revenue such as the radio and the cinema Indeed why not take these extremely important means in hand and put on this job real Bolsheviks shock workers who could successfully expand the business and make it possible at last to reduce the output of vodkaAs regards foreign trade it seems to me that a number of the economic difficulties we are encountering are due to the insufficiency of exports Can we push exports forward I think we can Is everything being done to increase exports to the utmost I do not think that everything is being doneThe same must be said about reserves Those comrades are wrong who say sometimes thoughtlessly and sometimes because of their ignorance of the matter that we have no reserves No comrades we have some kind of reserves All the organs of our state from uyezd and gubernia to regional and central try to put something in reserve for a rainy day But these reserves are small That must be admitted Therefore the task is to increase reserves as much as possible even if that sometimes entails cutting down some current requirementsSuch comrades are the darker sides of our work of economic construction to which attention must be paid and which must be eliminated at all costs in order to be able to move forward at a faster rateFrom questions of the countrys economic situation let us pass to questions of the political situationa The working class Figures showing the numerical growth of the working class and of wageworkers generally In 192425 there were 8215000 wageworkers not including unemployed in 192627 there were 10346000 An increase of 25 per cent Of these manual workers including agricultural and seasonal numbered 5448000 in 192425 and in 1926277060000 An increase of 296 per cent Of these workers in largescale industry numbered 1794000 in 192425 and in 1926272388000 An increase of 33 per centThe material conditions of the working class In 192425 the wageworkers share of the national income amounted to 241 per cent and in 192627 it grew to 294 per cent which is 30 per cent above the wageworkers share of the national income before the war whereas the share of the national income received by other social groups including the bourgeoisie diminished during this period for example the share of the bourgeoisie dropped from 55 per cent to 48 per cent In 192425 real wages exclusive of social services of the workers in state industry as a whole amounted to 2518 Moscow computed rubles per month in 192627 they amounted to 3214 rubles which is an increase of 276 per cent for the two years and is 54 per cent above the prewar level If we add social insurance and cultural municipal and other services wages in 192425 were 1015 per cent of prewar and in 1926271284 per cent of prewar The social insurance funds increased from 461 million rubles in 192425 to 852 million rubles in 192627 ie by 85 per cent which made it possible to send 513000 persons to rest homes and sanatoriums to provide allowances for 460000 unemployed and 700000 pensioners disabled workers and disabled civil war veterans and to pay workers full wages during sicknessTwo years ago in 192425 expenditure on workers housing amounted to something over 132000000 rubles in 192526to something over 230000000 rubles in 192627282000000 rubles and in 192728 it will amount to something over 391000000 rubles including 50000000 rubles provided for in the Manifesto of the Central Executive Committee The total expenditure on workers housing in the past three years by industry transport local Executive Committees and cooperatives not including individual construction was 644700000 rubles and including the assignments for 1927281036 million rubles These assignments for the three years made it possible to build housing accommodation with a floor space of 4594000 sq metres and to provide accommodation for 257000 workers and counting their families for about 900000 personsThe question of unemployment I must say that there is a discrepancy here between the figures of the AllUnion Central Council of Trade Unions and those of the Peoples Commissariat of Labour I take the figures of the Peoples Commissariat of Labour because they cover the truly unemployed element connected with the labour exchanges According to the returns of the Peoples Commissariat of Labour the number of unemployed during the two years increased from 950000 to 1048000 Of these industrial workers constitute 165 per cent and brain workers and unskilled labourers 74 per cent Thus the chief source of unemployment in our country is the overpopulation in the countryside the fact that our industry has to some extent failed to absorb a certain minimum of industrial workers is only a subsidiary sourceTo sum up there is an undoubted rise in the standard of living of the working class as a wholeThe Partys task to continue along the line of further improving the material and cultural conditions of the working class offurther raising the wages of the working classb The peasantry I do not think it is worth while quoting figures on differentiation among the peasantry because my report is already too long and everybody is familiar with the figures There can be no doubt that differentiation under the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot be identified with differentiation under the capitalist system Under capitalism the extremes grow the poor peasants and the kulaks while the middle peasants melt away In our country the opposite is the case the number of middle peasants is growing because a certain part of the poor peasants rise to the position of middle peasants the number of kulaks is growing the number of poor peasants is diminishing This fact shows that the central figure in agriculture is as previously the middle peasant The bloc with the middle peasants while relying on the poor peasants is of decisive importance for the fate of our entire work of construction for the dictatorship of the proletariatThe general improvement of material conditions in the countryside We have figures on the increase in the incomes of the peasant population Two years ago in 192425 the income of the peasant population amounted to 3548 million rubles in 192627 this income grew to 4792 million rubles ie it increased 351 per cent whereas the peasant population during this period increased only 238 per cent This is an indubitable indication that material conditions in the countryside are improvingThis does not mean that the material conditions of the peasantry have improved in all districts of the country It is well known that in some places the harvest was uneven during these two years and the effects of the crop failure of 1924 have not yet been fully overcome Hence the assistance the state renders the working peasantry in general and the poor peasants in particular In 192526 state assistance to the working peasantry amounted to 373000000 rubles and in 192627 to 427000000 rubles Special assistance to the rural poor in 192526 in the shape of grants to the poorest farms amounted to 38000000 rubles tax exemptions for poor farms amounted to 44000000 rubles and insurance exemptions for poor peasants to 9000000 rubles making a total of 91000000 rubles Special assistance to the rural poor in 192627 under the same heads 39000000 rubles 52000000 rubles and 9000000 rubles making a total of about 100000000 rublesTo sum up there is an improvement in the material conditions of the main mass of the peasantryThe Party s task to continue along the line of further improving the material and cultural conditions of the main mass of the peasantry primarily of the poor peasants to strengthen the alliance between the working class and the peasantry to raise the prestige of the working class and of its Party in the countrysidec The new bourgeoisie The intelligentsia A characteristic feature of the new bourgeoisie is that unlike the working class and the peasantry it has no reason to be satisfied with the Soviet regime Its dissatisfaction is not accidental It has its roots in lifeI have spoken about the growth of our national economy I have spoken about the growth of our industry about the growth of the socialist elements of our national economy about the decline in the relative importance of the private owners about the elimination of the small traders But what does that mean It means that while our industry and our trading bodies are growing tens of thousands of small and medium capitalists are being ruined How many small and medium shops have been closed during these years Thousands And how many small manufacturers have been proletarianised Thousands And how many civil servants have been discharged in connection with the reduction of staffs in our state apparatus Hundreds and thousandsThe progress of our industry the progress of our trading and cooperative bodies the improvement of our state apparatus is progress and improvement of benefit to the working class of benefit to the main mass of the peasantry but of disadvantage to the new bourgeoisie of disadvantage to the middle strata generally and to the urban middle strata in particular Is it to be wondered at that discontent with the Soviet regime is growing among those strata Hence the counterrevolutionary moods in those circles Hence the SmenaVekhist ideology as a fashionable commodity on the political market of the new bourgeoisieBut it would be a mistake to think that the whole of the civil service element the whole of the intelligentsia is in a state of discontent in a state of grumbling or unrest against the Soviet regime Parallel with the growth of discontent in the depths of the new bourgeoisie we have the fact of a differentiation among the intelligentsia a desertion from SmenaVekhism the passing of hundreds and thousands of working intellectuals to the side of the Soviet regime This fact comrades is undoubtedly a favourable fact which must be notedThe pioneers in this are the technical intelligentsia because being closely connected with the process of production they cannot but see that the Bolsheviks are leading the country forward to a better future Such gigantic works of construction as the Volkhov Power Plant the Dnieper Power Plant the Svir Power Plant the Turkestan Railway the VolgaDon project and a whole series of new gigantic industrial plants with which the fate of whole strata of the technical intelligentsia is bound up cannot but exercise some beneficial influence upon these strata It is not only a bread and butter question for them it is also a matter of honour a matter of creative effort which naturally draws them to the working class to the Soviet regimeThat is apart from the rural working intelligentsia especially village schoolteachers who began to support the Soviet regime long ago and who cannot help welcoming the development of education in the countrysideTherefore parallel with the growth of dissatisfaction among certain strata of the intelligentsia we have the bond between the working intelligentsia and the working classThe Party s task is to continue along the line of isolating the new bourgeoisie and to strengthen the bond between the working class and the working Soviet intelligentsia in town and countryd The state apparatus and the struggle against bureaucracy So much is being said about bureaucracy that there is no need to dilate on it That elements of bureaucracy exist in our state cooperative and Party apparatus there can be no doubt That it is necessary to combat the elements of bureaucracy and that this task will confront us all the time as long as we have state power as long as the state exists is also a factBut one must know how far one can go To carry the struggle against bureaucracy in the state apparatus to the point of destroying the state apparatus of discrediting the state apparatus of attempts to break it up that means going against Leninism means forgetting that our apparatus is a Soviet apparatus which is a state apparatus of a higher type than any other state apparatus in the worldWherein lies the strength of our state apparatus In that it links the state power with the millions of workers and peasants through the Soviets In that the Soviets are schools of administration for tens and hundreds of thousands of workers and peasants In that the state apparatus does not fence itself off from the vast masses of the people but merges with them through an incalculable number of mass organisations all sorts of commissions committees conferences delegate meetings etc which encompass the Soviets and in this way buttress the organs of governmentWherein lies the weakness of our state apparatus In the existence within it of elements of bureaucracy which spoil and distort its work In order to eliminate bureaucracy from itand this cannot be done in one or two yearswe must systematically improve the state apparatus bring it closer to the masses reinvigorate it by bringing in new people loyal to the cause of the working class remodel it in the spirit of communism but not break it up or discredit it Lenin was a thousand times right when he said Without an apparatus we would have perished long ago If we do not wage a systematic and stubborn struggle to improve the apparatus we shall perish before we have created the base for socialism 13I shall not dilate on those defects in our state apparatus that are glaring enough as it is I have in mind primarily Mother Red Tape I have at hand a heap of materials on the matter of red tape exposing the criminal negligence of a number of judicial administrative insurance cooperative and other organisationsHere is a peasant who went to a certain insurance office twentyone times to get some matter put right and even then failed to get any resultHere is another peasant an old man of sixtysix who walked 600 versts to get his case cleared up at an Uyezd Social Maintenance Office and even then failed to get any resultHere is an old peasant woman fiftysix years old who in response to a summons by a peoples court walked 500 versts and travelled over 600 versts by horse and cart and even then failed to get justice doneA multitude of such facts could be quoted It is not worth while enumerating them But this is a disgrace to us comrades How can such outrageous things be toleratedLastly facts about demoting It appears that in addition to workers who are promoted there are also such as are demoted who are pushed into the background by their own comrades not because they are incapable or inefficient but because they are conscientious and honest in their workHere is a worker a toolmaker who was promoted to a managerial post at his plant because he was a capable and incorruptible man He worked for a couple of years worked honestly introduced order put a stop to inefficiency and waste But working in this way he trod on the toes of a gang of socalled Communists he disturbed their peace and quiet And what happened This gang of Communists put a spoke in his wheel and thus compelled him to demote himself as much as to say You wanted to be smarter than us you wont let us live and make a bit in quietso take a back seat brotherHere is another worker also a toolmaker an adjuster of boltcutting machines who was promoted to a managerial post at his factory He worked zealously and honestly But working in this way he disturbed somebodys peace and quiet And what happened A pretext was found and they got rid of this troublesome comrade How did this promoted comrade leave what were his feelings Like this In whatever post I was appointed to I tried to justify the confidence that was placed in me But this promotion played a dirty trick on me and I shall never forget it They threw mud at me My wish to bring everything into the light of day remained a mere wish Neither the works committee nor the management nor the Party unit would listen to me I am finished with promotion I would not take another managerial post even if offered my weight in gold Trud 14 No 128 June 9 1927But this is a disgrace to us comrades How can such outrageous things be toleratedThe Partys task is in fighting against bureaucracy and for the improvement of the state apparatus to extirpate with a redhot iron such outrageous things in our practical work as those I have just spoken aboute Concerning Lenins slogan about the cultural revolution The surest remedy for bureaucracy is raising the cultural level of the workers and peasants One can curse and denounce bureaucracy in the state apparatus one can stigmatise and pillory bureaucracy in our practical work but unless the masses of the workers reach a certain level of culture which will create the possibility the desire the ability to control the state apparatus from below by the masses of the workers themselves bureaucracy will continue to exist in spite of everything Therefore the cultural development of theworking class and of the masses of the working peasantry not only the development of literacy although literacy is the basis of all culture but primarily the cultivation of the ability to take part in the administration of the country is the chief lever for improving the state and every other apparatus This is the sense and significance of Lenins slogan about the cultural revolutionHere is what Lenin said about this in March 1922 before the opening of the Eleventh Congress of our Party in his letter to the Central Committee addressed to Comrade MolotovThe chief thing we lack is culture ability to administer    Economically and politically NEP fully ensures us the possibility of laying the foundation of socialist economy It is only a matter of the cultural forces of the proletariat and of its vanguard 15These words of Lenins must not be forgotten comrades Voices  Quite rightHence the Partys task to exert greater efforts to raise the cultural level of the working class and of the working strata of the peasantry  How can the internal political situation in our country be summed upIt can be summed up in this way The Soviet regime is the most stable regime in the world Stormy applauseBut while the Soviet regime is stronger than all the other regimes existing in the world a regime that any bourgeois government may envy that does not mean that all is well with us in this sphere No comrades we have shortcomings in this sphere too which we as Bolsheviks cannot and must not concealFirstly we have unemployment This is a serious shortcoming which we must overcome or at least reduce to a minimum at all costsSecondly we have grave defects in housing construction for the workers a housing crisis which we must also overcome or at least reduce to a minimum within the next few yearsWe have some manifestations of antiSemitism not only among certain circles of the middle strata of the population but also among a certain section of the workers and even in some quarters in our Party This evil must be combated comrades with all ruthlessnessWe also have a shortcoming like the slackening in the struggle against religionAnd lastly we have a terrible cultural backwardness not only in the broad sense of the term but also in its narrow sense in the sense of elementary literacy for the percentage of illiteracy in the USSR is still not inconsiderableAll these and similar shortcomings must be eliminated comrades if we want to advance at a more or less rapid rateTo finish with this section of my report permit me to say a few words about the most characteristic appointments during the period under review I shall not touch on the appointment of the ViceChairmen of the Council of Peoples Commissars of the USSR Nor shall I touch on the appointment of the Peoples Commissars of the Supreme Council of National Economy of the Peoples Commissariat of Trade and of the Joint State Political Administration of the USSR I would like to deal with three appointments that are significant You know that Lobov has been appointed Chairman of the Supreme Council of National Economy of the RSFSR He is a metalworker You know that Ukhanov a metalworker has been elected Chairman of the Moscow Soviet in place of Kamenev You know also that Komarov also a metalworker has been elected Chairman of the Leningrad Soviet in place of Zinoviev Thus the Lord Mayors of our two capitals are metalworkers Applause It is true that they are not of the nobility but they are managing the affairs of our capitals better than any member of the nobility Applause You may say that this is a tendency towards metallisation but I dont think there is anything bad about that Voices On the contrary it is very goodLet us wish the capitalist countries let us wish London let us wish Paris success in catching up with us at last and in putting up their own metalworkers as Lord Mayors ApplauseIIIThe Party and the OppositionComrades I shall not deal at length with the numerical and ideological growth of our Party I shall not quote figures because Kosior will report to you on this in detailNor shall I speak about the social composition of our Party or about the figures relating to this because Kosior will give you exhaustive data on it in his reportI should like to say a few words about the higher level the qualitative improvement in our Partys work of leadership both in the sphere of economics and in the sphere of politics There was a time comrades two or three years ago when a section of our comrades headed by Trotsky I think laughter voices Think rebuked our Gubernia Committeesour Regional Committees and our Central Committee asserting that the Party organisations were not competent to interfere in the countrys economic affairs and had no business to do so Yes there was such a time Today however it is doubtful whether anybody would dare to cast such accusations at the Party organisations That the Gubernia and Regional Committees have mastered the art of economic leadership that the Party organisations are leading the work of economic construction and not trailing in its rear is such a glaring fact that only the blind or imbecile would dare to deny it The very fact that we have decided to put on the agenda of this congress the question of a fiveyear plan of development of the national economy this very fact alone shows that the Party has made immense progress in the planned leadership of our work of economic construction both in the districts and at the centreSome people think that there is nothing special about this No comrades there is something special and important about this which must be noted Reference is sometimes made to American and German economic bodies which it is alleged also direct their national economy in a planned way No comrades those countries have not yet achieved this and never will achieve it as long as the capitalist system exists there To be able to lead in a planned way it is necessary to have a different system of industry a socialist and not a capitalist system it is necessary to have at least a nationalised industry a nationalised credit system nationalised land a socialist bond with the countryside workingclass rule in the country etcTrue they also have something in the nature of plans but these are forecast plans guesswork plans not binding on anybody and they cannot serve as a basis for directing the countrys economy Things are different in our country Our plans are not forecast plans not guesswork plans but directive plans which are binding upon our leading bodies and which determine the trend of our future economic development on a countrywide scaleYou see we have a fundamental difference hereThat is why I say that even the mere fact that the question of a fiveyear plan of development of the national economy has been put on the congress agenda even this fact is a sign of the qualitatively higher level of our leadership in planningNor shall I deal at length with the growth of innerParty democracy in our Party Only the blind fail to see that innerParty democracy genuine innerParty democracy an actual upsurge of activity on the part of the mass of the Party membership is growing and developing in our Party There is talk about democracy But what is democracy in the Party Democracy for whom If by democracy is meant freedom for a couple or so of intellectuals divorced from the revolution to engage in endless chatter to have their own press organ etc then we have no use for such democracy because it is democracy for an insignificant minority that sets at naught the will of the overwhelming majority If however by democracy is meant freedom for the mass of the Party membership to decide questions connected with our work of construction an upsurge of activity of the Party membership drawing them into the work of Party leadership developing in them the feeling that they are the masters in the Party then we have such democracy that is the democracy we need and we shall steadily develop it in spite of everything ApplauseNor shall I comrades deal at length with the fact that parallel with innerParty democracy collective leadership is growing step by step in our Party Take our Central Committee and the Central Control Commission Together they constitute a leading centre of 200250 comrades which meets regularly and decides highly important questions connected with our work of construction It is one of the most democratic and collectively functioning centres our Party has ever had Well Is it not a fact that the settlement of highly important questions concerning our work is passing more and more from the hands of a narrow upper group into the hands of this broad centre which is most closely connected with all branches of our work of construction and with all the districts of our vast countryNor shall I dilate on the growth of our Party cadres It is indisputable that during the past few years the old cadres of our Party have been permeated with new rising cadres consisting mainly of workers Formerly we counted our cadres in hundreds and thousands but now we have to count them in tens of thousands I think that if we begin from the lowest organisations the shop and team organisations and proceed to the top all over the Union we shall find that our Party cadres the overwhelming majority of whom are workers now number not less than 100000 This indicates the immense growth of our Party It indicates the immense growth of our cadres the growth of their ideological and organisational experience the growth of their communist cultureLastly there is one further question which there is no need to deal with at length but which ought to be mentioned That is the question of the growth of the Partys prestige among the nonParty workers and the masses of the working people in general of our country among the workers and the oppressed classes in general all over the world There can scarcely be any doubt now that our Party is becoming the banner of liberation for the masses of the working people all over the world and that the title of Bolshevik is becoming a title of honour for the best members of the working classSuch in general comrades is the picture of our achievements in the sphere of Party affairsThis does not mean comrades that there are no shortcomings in our Party No there are shortcomings and grave ones at that Permit me to say a few words about themLet us take for example the guidance of economic and other organisations by our Party organisations Is all well with us in this respect No not all Often we settle questions not only in the districts but also at the centre by the family domesticcircle method so to speak Ivan Ivanovich a member of the top leadership of such and such an organisation has say made a gross mistake and has messed things up But Ivan Fyodorovich is reluctant to criticise him to expose his mistakes and to correct them He is reluctant to do so because he does not want to make enemies He has made a mistake he has messed things upwhat of it Who of us does not make mistakes Today I shall let him Ivan Fyodorovich off tomorrow he will let me Ivan Ivanovich off for what guarantee is there that I too shall not make a mistake Everything in order and satisfactory Peace and good will They say that a mistake neglected is detrimental to our great cause Never mind Well muddle through somehowSuch comrades is the way some of our responsible workers usually argueBut what does that mean If we Bolsheviks who criticise the whole world who in the words of Marx are storming heaven if we for the sake of this or that comrades peace of mind abandon selfcriticism is it not obvious that that can lead only to the doom of our great cause Voices Quite right ApplauseMarx said that what among other things distinguishes the proletarian revolution from every other revolution is that it criticises itself and in criticising itself strengthens itself 16 That is an extremely important point of Marxs If we the representatives of the proletarian revolution shut our eyes to our defects settle questions by the familycircle method hush up each others mistakes and drive the ulcers inwards into the organism of the Party who will correct these mistakes these defectsIs it not obvious that we shall cease to be proletarian revolutionaries and that we shall certainly perish if we fail to eradicate from our midst this philistinism this familycircle method of settling highly important questions of our work of constructionIs it not obvious that by refraining from honest and straightforward selfcriticism by refraining from honest and open correction of our mistakes we close our road to progress to the improvement of our work to new successes in our workAfter all our development does not proceed in the form of a smooth allround ascent No comrades we have classes we have contradictions within the country we have a past we have a present and a future we have contradictions between them and our onward progress cannot take the form of a smooth rocking on the waves of life Our advance takes place in the process of struggle in the process of the development of contradictions in the process of overcoming these contradictions in the process of bringing these contradictions to light and eliminating themAs long as classes exist we shall never be in a position to say Well""",CheckYourFact,fake,1,100

crosscultural degeneration of traditional values risking life on earth This history concerns A440Hz standard tuning and the Rockefeller Foundations military commercialization of music The monopolization of the music industry features this imposed frequency that is herding populations into greater aggression psychosocial agitation and emotional distress predisposing people to physical illnesses and financial impositions profiting the agents agencies and companies engaged in the monopoly Alternatively the most natural instinctively attractive A444Hz C5528Hz frequency that is most vividly displayed botanically has been suppressed That is the good vibrations that the plant kingdom obviously broadcasts in its greenishyellow display remedial to emotional distress social aggression and more has been musically censored Thus a musical revolution is needed to advance world health and peace and has already begun with musicians retuning their instruments to perform optimally impact audiences beneficially and restore integrity to the performing arts and sciences Music makers are thus urged to communicate and debate these facts condemn the militarization of music that has been secretly administered and retune instruments and voices to frequencies most sustaining and healingIntroductionContrary to popular opinion the most powerful hard science influencing society politics and economics is behavioral science This generally neglected fact enables advertising agencies social engineers marketing firms and the persuasive media to direct people like cattle most profitablyA flock of sheep for example according to the Merck Veterinary Manual responds synchronously to stimuli such as approaching dogs or humans due to a special set of nerve cells that fire electrically causing the release of stress hormones associated with the flight response and herd behavior1 Malcolm Gladwells The Tipping Point How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference cites social examples of the small levels or percentages of a total population required to act at which the momentum for change becomes unstoppable for the entire social network2There have been many unexplained mass hysteria episodes recorded besides the War of the Worlds fright that was broadcast by CBS Radio and narrated by Orson Welles on October 30 19383 Bartholomew called a related public health crisis Occupational Mass Psychogenic Illness in Transcultural Psychiatry4 Wessely added the warning that this bizarre herd behavior impacting health and wellbeing reflects poorly on our mass mindset inspired by the terroristic media He wroteIt is easy to lose sight of the dynamic protean varied nature of mass sociogenic illness and its historical and transcultural manifestations which mirror popular social and cultural preoccupations that define each era and reflect unique social beliefs about the nature of the world5BackgroundAssuming the field of physics including biophysics is valid and the universe including life is primordially constructed energetically mathematicallyharmonicallymusicallyenergy including bioenergy or spirituality as a medium of consciousness impacts us physically very powerfully and is mediated vibrationally really hydrosonically through sounds effects on water6Water nearly eighty percent of human body weight is a liquid crystal superconductor Structured water science 7  as well as the field of electrogenetics 6  proves this thesis adequately given light photons and sound phonons have been shown to signal communications within and between cells  via a liquid crystal proteoglycan matrix in cells and tissues 6  This strongly evidences the theory of hydrosonic creationism involving DNA and structured water 7  Thus biocreation and health restoration may have more to do with frequencies of sound energy or music than has been thoughtThere are a lot of people who consider modern music annoying Many become emotionally disturbed listening to certain types of music What few people realize regardless of the type of music played in the Western World the standard AngloAmerican tuning for instruments and voices was instituted at the same time by the same agents and agencies advancing acoustic war studies for inducing mass hysteria8Analyzing the antecedents of current geopolitics and economics this dirty fact of musical history may be foundational to the statusquo and instrumental to contemporary sociocultural crises including modern pandemic psychopathologyThroughout history there have been persons of wealth and power engaged in warmaking profiteering and various methods of population control In 1770 for instance Mayer Amschel Bauer aka Rothschild developed plans for the creation of the Illuminati advancing the mission of global domination through a network of central banks that his family and their silent partners controlled9 10 Many reputable authors track todays degenerative socioeconomic trends and aboriginal genocides to the Illuminatis powerful influence administered through private organizations controlling multinational corporations and governments ie secret societies and governing councils such as the Council on Foreign Relations615As a result of this influence wrote Thomas D Schauf in a controversial review article and commentary urging the termination of the unAmerican Federal Reserve Bank and the offshore bankers control over the US Treasury the arc of Western Civilization has gone from ascentbelief in Godfocused on the higher centers of love joy purity and selflessness to descent    focused on the lower centers of consciousness like those of power wealth and physical gratification The apex was called the Enlightenment when the Illuminated onesa Luciferian term meaning keepers of the lighttook over for God Typical of Satan decline into moral darkness is represented as light 11Light and sound is generated and measured mathematically according to frequencies It stands to reason then following Schaufs empirically evidenced thesis we are engaged in a conspiracy reality in which ultimate power and control is waged bioenergetically ie biospiritually through frequency modulations or electromagnetic manipulations affecting consciousness and impacting biology physiology and human behaviorThe Rockefeller Foundation and Military MusicIn 1913 the Rothschilds set up their third and current central bank in America the Federal Reserve Bank with the help of their agents JP Morgan and JD Rockefeller whose investments in American industry had been Rothschildfinanced since 1865 9 1111World Wars I and II evidence the banking cartels profitable depopulation politics and policies For instance in 1914 at the beginning of World War I the German Rothschild bank loaned money to the German government the British Rothschild bank loaned money to Britain and the French Rothschild bank loaned money to the French government War propaganda served the Rothschilds geopolitical and financial agendas and was provided by the three main European news agencies Wolff in Germany Reuters in England and Havas in France each financed by Rothschild banks  9Between World Wars I and II accelerating during the 1930s scientific studies in musical frequencies best suited for warmaking were funded by the RothschildRockefeller alliance represented by the Rockefeller Foundation and US Navy811A major objective of this war and profitable population control research was to determine the musical factors capable of producing psychopathology emotional distress and mass hysteria8Academically directed by grants provided by the Rockefeller Foundation in concert with the US Navy and National Defense Research Council according to the foundations archives acoustic energy researchers including Harold BurrisMeyer an audio engineer and drama instructor at New Jerseys Stevens Institute of Technology were commissioned8BurrisMeyer is best known for providing consulting services to the Muzak Corporation which used his expertise to optimize sound installations in factories so that emotional motivation of workers achieved through music would not be adversely effected by factory noise    wrote James Tobias a Professor of English at the Univ of Calif8Tobias reviewed Rockefeller Foundation RF archives and documented investigations leading to psychological warfare applications of acoustic vibrations ultimately advanced militarily and commercially 8BurrisMeyer according to Tobias contributed to the Department of Defense during World War II including building speaker arrays deployed on warplanes such that enemy combatants could be addressed from the air to produce psychoemotional affects leading to mass hysteria8Additionally the Princeton Radio Project played a role in this research This occurred precisely at the time the atomic bomb Manhattan Project was beginning at Princeton involving Albert Einstein at the Institute for Advanced Study IAS12Poisonous Medicine and the Rockefeller Foundations Investments in Sickening MusicLinking this conspiracy reality to the development of music for mass hysteria and aversive public health impacts the IAS think tank was formed from the vision of founding Director Abraham Flexner according to the IAS website13 The infamous Abraham Flexner educated in Germany and America on staff at the Carnegie Foundation and funded by the Rockefeller Foundation sourced the American medical reformation following US Congressional acceptance of his Flexner Report14 This infamous treatise exclusively benefited the AngloAmerican IG FarbenRockefeller petrochemicalpharmaceutical alliance that vilified every form of natural healing to monopolize healthcare Based on Flexners report advancing the Rockefellers agenda the US Government exclusively imposed medicines reliance on deadly not curative drugs as is ongoing todayThe Rockefeller Foundations Assistant Director for the Humanities at the time Flexner compiled his report was John Marshall who along with the authors of Composing for the Films Oxford University Press 1947 Hanns Eisler and Theodor Adorno were featured performers in the musical projects serving military and commercial interests juxtaposed with artistic and philanthropic objectives8As this research and development of the broadcasting industry advanced to impact herd behavior and public health it is clear that any malady generated musicallyvibrationally ie bioenergetically would increase investors profitabilityAlthough Eisler or Adorno appear to be innocent of wrongdoing according to Tobias both were unfavorably treated by project officials Eisler opposed the militarization of music used for cultural manipulation and was eventually deported following years of harassment by the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI This publicity generated embarrassment for the Rockefeller Foundation 8According to Tobias BurrisMeyer became convinced that audio control of human emotions was possible for a large enough portion of an audience to provide effective crowd control  a line of research that John Marshall ultimately found irrelevant for understanding the artistic or cultural values of music     but obviously fulfilled a military objective8This best explains why this activity is linked in time subject matter Foundation funding and the RothschildRockefeller increasing war investments in Germany Great Britain and the US to establishing the Western Worlds standard musical tuning of A440Hz frequencyThe fact that A440Hz standard tuning is relatively distressing as adequately evidenced below and elsewhere7 2022 implicates these parties and their research into aversive musical frequencies for military and commercial

1618,1334,"""Aug 11 2022  It might be a good time to stock up on home COVID19 tests Today the FDA issued new guidance on athome COVID testing It still recommends repeat testing after a negative result but is also recommending that people who have no symptoms but think they have been exposed take three tests instead of two If a first or repeat test is positive follow the CDC guidance on isolation and get medical care If the first test is negative and you have symptoms test again 48 hours later You may choose to test yet again 48 hours after the second test and may also consider getting a laboratory molecularbased PCR test and seeking medical care If the first test is negative you dont have symptoms but you believe you have been exposed test again 48 hours later then 48 hours after the second negative for a total of at least three tests After three negative tests if you are concerned the FDA suggests testing again at home getting a PCR test or getting medical advice Current guidelines from the CDC recommend testing at home right away if you get symptoms If you have been exposed to COVID19 it recommends testing at least 5 days after exposure  and if that test is negative it says to consider testing again 12 days later The new guidance from the FDA is based on findings from a new study by University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School researchers showed the new timelines are more likely to detect an infection Researchers evaluated 5609 people who are enrolled in the national Test Us At Home study from October 2021 to January The participants used one of three retail test kits and also collected a sample for a molecular PCR test They tested every 48 hours for 15 days During the study period 154 people tested positive for the coronavirus that causes COVID19 based on the PCR samples After testing twice at home over 48 hours more than 90 of infections were detected in symptomatic people who began testing within the first weekSerial testing three times with an athome test at 48hour intervals detected more than 75 of infections an increase from about 60 after testing just twice The study is published as a preprint and is not yet peerreviewed Bottom line from the study Athome antigen tests are more likely to detect COVID19 within the first week of infection if a person who doesnt have symptoms tests three times with 48 hours in between each test and people with symptoms test twice with the one 48hour interval Antigen tests work as long as people use them as indicated says Apurv Soni MD an assistant professor of medicine at UMass and the studys principal investigator The problem is the research on how to use home tests has been squishy His team set out to find out how well the home tests could detect SARSCoV2 the virus that causes COVID19 for people with and without symptoms The analysis included only people who had no symptoms and tested negative by both athome antigen and PCR tests on the first day of the study The home tests used in the study were Quidels QuickVUE AtHome Abbotts BinaxNOW and Becton Dickinson and Companys BD Veritor For those with symptoms who tested negative twice those two tests found about 94 of the infections Soni says But if you are asymptomatic you have to do three tests 48 hours apart to capture 79 of the infections The FDAs new safety communication is based on the study finding that when those without symptoms test just twice many infections go undiscovered making it easy to spread the infection to others Those without symptoms may simply not have enough virus in their body to get a positive test at first says Carly Herbert an MDPhD candidate at UMass Chan Medical School one of the study coauthors The rapid antigen test is very correlated with viral load That may be why it takes that long The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics Tech programTranslating advice about when and how to do home tests to realworld situations isnt simple Soni says especially for those who dont have symptoms If someone goes to a party and then has symptoms they could start testing then and repeat the test twice he says If both are negative theres a 94 chance they dont have COVID according to the UMass study If you dont have symptoms do three tests 48 hours apart sometime after you find out you were exposed Soni says acknowledging that the notification time varies His team is reviewing data from their research on those details as well as ideal timelines and hopes to have more information soon he says The study looked at a question that needs addressing says William Schaffner MD a professor of preventive medicine and infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center A lot of people see that one negative test as a Get out of jail free card What the researchers have found is that with the development of time you are more likely to test positive he says Biological differences between COVID19 variants may explain differences in testing and failure to pick up an infection on the first test says Wilbur Lam MD PhD a professor at Emory University and the Georgia Institute of Technology The rapid tests compared to traditional PCR tests seem to be less sensitive with false negatives especially in the first few days of infection Testing serially improves that sensitivity he says The study findings are not surprising says Amesh Adalja MD a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore Serial testing with an antigen test especially in asymptomatic individuals will be more likely to pick up cases he says For those who dont have symptoms the test results give valuable information about whether they will be infectious to others The study data is solid Schaffner says But with advice to test more public officials are going to have to supply more tests if they hope people will comply he says Will people follow the new advice There will be a segment of the population

315,1535,"""With the emergence of an alleged new variant that the UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid said may evade the current vaccines despite also saying that is why you should get your boosters in the same sentence we felt it was best to take you on a journey through three months worth of UKHSA Covid19 data to show you why if the rumours are true the unvaccinated population have absolutely nothing to worry about but the vaccinated population have everything to fearYouve most likely been seeing headlines like Worst Ever Covid Variant in the mainstream media such as this one from the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation funded newspaper The GuardianBut we doubt the same mainstream media trying to once again frighten the nation into compliance with inevitable Draconian restrictions has informed you that this alleged new variant was first discovered among four individuals each of them fully vaccinatedCurrent trends suggest that the unvaccinated will no doubt be blamed for the emergence of this new variant and the onslaught of propaganda designed to sway the nation into supporting a lockdown of the unvaccinated will probably now pick up paceBut is this justifiedThe UK Health Security Agency UKHSA publish a weekly Vaccine Surveillance report containing statistics on Covid19 cases hospitalisations and deaths by vaccination status across England over the past four weeksTheir latest report published Thursday November 25th covers data on infections hospitalisations and deaths from Week 43 to Week 46 of 2021 October 25th  November 21stThe report reveals that there were 833332 recorded Covid19 cases 9094 Covid19 hospitalisations and 3700 Covid19 deaths from October 25th to November 21st Of these the unvaccinated accounted for 39 of all cases 34 of all hospitalisations and 19 of all deaths Whilst the vaccinated accounted for 61 of all cases 66 of all hospitalisations and 81 of all deathsBut a more detailed look at three months worth of Covid19 data published by the agency reveals that projections show the fully vaccinated were already in for a very rough winter prior to the alleged emergence of the worst ever Covid19 variant Infections rates are already much higher among the fully vaccinated and the casefatality rate is frighteningly worse than what is being seen among the unvaccinated populationWe used the following reports for our analysis Covid19 CasesThe following chart shows the total number of cases over four week periods from August 30th to November 21st 2021 as per table 8 of the Vaccine Surveillance reportsThe chart reveals that things are improving for the unvaccinated population in terms of cases whilst they are getting worse for the fully vaccinated populationThe unvaccinated accounted for the majority of Covid19 cases between both week 3538 and week 3942 But the most recent four weeks have seen a significant switch with the unvaccinated cases declining by nearly 100000 cases from week 3942 whilst the fully vaccinated cases increased by around 53000Its also worth noting that a steady increase has been recorded amongst the partly vaccinated population over the past three months and the reason for this is that children who are currently only eligible for a single dose are still catching Covid19This is despite Professor Chris Whitty the Chief Medical Officer for England claiming he was overruling the JCVI because the jab would help in preventing further disruption to the education of childrenWe knew this was a lie at the time because the jabs cannot and do not prevent infection or transmission of the virus but now we have the evidence to confirm itThe above chart shows the cumulative number of cases over the past three months by vaccination status as well as the projected number of cases per week up to the 2nd week of January 2022 based on the current trendAs things stand there were 1067859 Covid19 cases among the unvaccinated population between Oct 25th and November 21st with projections showing cases could increase to a cumulative total of approximately 25 million by the second week of January 2022 among the unvaccinatedBut there are far more cases among the fully vaccinated population with 1108306 cases being recorded between Oct 25th and Nov 21st and projections show cases could rise to a cumulative total of approximately 48 million by the second week of JanuaryThis chart proves that even without the alleged new variant we were already going to see a Pandemic of the Fully Vaccinated this winterCovid19 HospitalisationsThe following chart shows the total number of hospitalisations over four week periods from August 30th to November 21st 2021 as per table 9 of the Vaccine Surveillance reportsThe chart shows that hospitalisations among the unvaccinated have floated around the 3000 mark over four week periods throughout the past three monthsBut unfortunately for the fully vaccinated population hospitalisations among this group have been getting progressively worse by the monthThe number of hospitalisations among the fully vaccinated between week 43 and 46 is 30 higher than the number of hospitalisations among the fully vaccinated between week 35 and 38 Whereas the number of hospitalisations among the unvaccinated between week 43 and 46 is just 5 higher than the number recorded between week 35 and 38This shows that the fully vaccinated are currently the biggest burden on the NHS not the unvaccinated and it also shows us something peculiar in terms of the overall picture considering the vaccines are supposed to reduce the risk of hospitalisationIn all there were 1067859 cases among the unvaccinated between August 30th and November 21st Therefore with a total of 8825 hospitalisations the casehospitalisation rate among the unvaccinated is 082However with 1108306 cases among the vaccination population during the same time frame and 15191 hospitalisations the casehospitalisation rate among the fully vaccinated is 137Therefore the casehospitalisation rate among the fully vaccinated is 67 higher than the casehospitalisation rate among the unvaccinated Should this be the case when the Covid19 injections are alleged to reduce the risk of hospitalisation by up to 95The above chart shows the cumulative number of hospitalisations over the past three months by vaccination status as well as the projected number of hospitalisations up to the second week of 2022 and yet again things arent looking promising for the fully vaccinatedHospitalisations are projected to rapidly rise to an accumulative total of approximately 67500 among the fully vaccinated an increase of 52309 Whilst the projected number of hospitalisations among the unvaccinated is expected to rise to approximately 17500  an increase of 8675The vaccinated have currently accounted for 64 of hospitalisations since August 30th but from November 21st to the second week of 2022 they are projected to account for 86 of hospitalisations meaning they may have accounted for 80 of hospitalisations since August 30th by the time new year resolutions have gone out the windowCovid19 DeathsThe following chart shows the total number of deaths over four week periods from August 30th to November 21st 2021 as per table 10 of the Vaccine Surveillance reportsFrom August 30th to November 21st England recorded a total of 9592 deaths Of these just 1882 were among the unvaccinated population whilst a shocking 7710 were among the vaccinated population with nearly 3000 of these deaths occurring in just the last four weeksDoes this make sense to you when the fully vaccinated account for only 47 of cases and the vaccines are alleged to reduce the risk of death by 95The above chart shows the cumulative number of deaths over the past three months by vaccination status as well as the projected number of deaths up to the second week of 2022 and things are looking disastrous for the fully vaccinated populationDeaths are projected to rapidly rise to an accumulative total of approximately 34000 among the fully vaccinated an increase of 26574 Whilst the projected number of deaths among the unvaccinated is expected to rise to just 4500 an increase of 2618Covid19 Case  Hospitalisation  Fatality RatesThe above chart shows the total number of Covid19 hospitalisations and deaths by vaccination status and allows us to compare the numbers side by side What this clearly demonstrates is that there is a much higher hospitalisationfatality rate among the fully vaccinated and partly vaccinated populations than the rate among the unvaccinated populationIn all there were 8825 hospitalisations and 1882 deaths among the unvaccinated between August 30th and November 21st Therefore the hospitalisationfatality rate is 213But with 15191 hospitalisations and 7426 deaths among the fully vaccinated population population the hospitalisationfatality rate is 4888This means the hospitalisationfatality rate among the fully vaccinated population over the past three months has been 130 higher than the hospitalisationfatality rate among the unvaccinated populationThe above chart shows the casehospitalisation rate No Cases  No Hosp casefatality rate No Cases  No Deaths and hospitalisation fatality rate No Hosp  No Deaths by vaccination statusIts quite concerning to find that all three rates are much higher among the vaccinated population we should surely be seeing the opposite if the Covid19 vaccines reduce the risk of hospitalisation and deathBut unfortunately the above figures do not just suggest that the vaccines are ineffective they actually suggest that they make the recipient worseA vaccine effectiveness of 95 against death from Covid19 would mean that the unvaccinated population have a 95 higher chance of dying if infected with Covid19 than the vaccinatedA vaccine effectiveness of 0 would mean that the vaccines are ineffective and the vaccinated and unvaccinated have the same chance of dying if infected with Covid19But a vaccine effectiveness of 95 would mean that the vaccines actually make the recipient worse by for example decimating the recipients immune system or invoking a response such as antibodydependentenhancement Which makes the following figures extremely concerningThe above chart shows the current increased risk of hospitalisation if infected with Covid19 the current increased risk of death if infected with Covid19 and the current increased risk of death if hospitalised with Covid19 among the fully vaccinated population The percentages have been calculated based on the Rates by Vaccination Status calculated in the previous chartThe chart shows that the fully vaccinated are 67 more likely to be hospitalised with Covid19 if infected therefore this shows that the Covid19 vaccines have an average vaccine effectiveness of 67 against hospitalisationBut the most concerning figure demonstrated on the above chart shows that the fully vaccinated are 294 more likely to die with Covid19 if infected This shows that the Covid19 vaccines have an average vaccine effectiveness of 294 against deathWhyThe reason the fully vaccinated are actually suffering far worse than the unvaccinated and are projected to suffer worse still could have something to do with the fact that the data suggests the Covid19 injections are decimating the immune systems of the vaccinated as we demonstrated in a previous article published Tuesday November 16th which can be viewed hereThe case rates per 100000 population contained in the UKHSA Vaccine Surveillance reports show that the fully vaccinated 30 to 79 yearolds have a much higher case rate than the unvaccinated population and things are getting progressively worse by the monthThis means the Covid19 injections are proving to have a negative effectiveness and this unfortunately suggests that they are decimating the fully vaccinated populations immune systems and we are seeing further evidence of this hidden in official government reportsFor instance the Week 42 Vaccine Surveillance report published by the UKHSA states the following Recent observations from UK Health Security Agency UKHSA surveillance data that N antibody levels appear to be lower in individuals who acquire infection following 2 doses of vaccinationWhat this means is that the Covid19 vaccines interfere with the immune systems ability to produce antibodies against other pieces of the SARSCoV2 virus following infection in the case of the N antibody this is against the nucleocapsid protein which is the shell of the virus and a crucial part of the immune system response in the unvaccinated populationTherefore if any mutations to the spike protein of the alleged SARSCoV2 virus occur in the future the vaccinated will be far more vulnerable and possibly unprotected due to their inability to produce the N antibody even if they have already been infected and recovered from Covid19Whereas the unvaccinated would have much better immunity to any mutations due to their ability to produce both S and N antibodies after infectionWhat do we knowThe new worst ever variant is called B11529 and is allegedly incredibly heavily mutatedProfessor Tulio de Oliveira the director of the Centre for Epidemic Response and Innovation in South Africa said there was an unusual constellation of mutations and that it was very different to other variants that have circulatedThis variant did surprise us it has a big jump on evolution and many more mutations than we expected he saidIn a media briefing Professor de Oliveira said there were 50 mutations overall and more than 30 on the spike protein which is the target of the Covid19 vaccines and now the only part of the Covid19 virus that the fully vaccinated are able to produce antibodies against as confirmed in the UKHSA reportTherefore  with 80 of deaths 65 of hospitalisations and 54 of cases being among the partly and fully vaccinated population since at least August 30th proving England is experiencing a Pandemic of the Fully Vaccinated and the vaccinated populations inability to produce the N antibody because of the vaccines only targeting the spike protein  the unvaccinated population have absolutely nothing to worry about but the vaccinated population have everything to fear in regard to the new worst ever Covid19 variantLike this Like

National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS part of the National Institutes of Health NINDSsupported investigators who secure an RPA will have their research funded for a period of five years with the potential to have that funding extended for up to an additional three years This funding initiative was developed to provide support for a grantees overall research program not just individual projectsNINDS created this pilot program to improve the value of the research it funds by enabling proven investigators to pursue longrange innovative research instead of continually writing and submitting grant applications said Walter Koroshetz MD the NINDS directorTraditionally the R01 Research Project Grant has been the primary source of NIH funding for laboratories However R01 awards provide support for up to five years for a specific set of experiments and multiple R01s are often necessary to fund a laboratorys body of work The RPA which uses the R35 award mechanism differs in that it enhances funding stability by providing longer consolidated support for a grantees overall research program rather than for individual projectsThe RPA will support the entirety of an investigators program of NINDS missionrelated research The grantees current NINDS funding will be consolidated into the RPA and extended over a longer period During the fifth year of the award progress will be reviewed to ensure that the research program is staying on course NINDS anticipates that most RPA awardees will be given the option to continue receiving funding for three additional yearsApplications for the R35 RPA were reviewed according to NIH peer review standards which include an assessment of investigators track records and the significance and relevance of their proposed research programs The 30 awardees include principal investigators at a variety of career stages and a range of topics that include the use of models such as fruit flies and yeast to better understand

of NIH and their collaborators Investigators aim to enroll between 18 and 30 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 60 The trial will expose participants to the Ebola virusEbola virus disease is a serious and often fatal illness that can cause fever headache muscle pain weakness fatigue diarrhea vomiting stomach pain and hemorrhage severe bleeding It was first discovered in humans in 1976 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo DRC and has caused periodic cases and outbreaks in several African countries since then The largest outbreak which occurred in West Africa from 2014 to 2016 caused more than 28600 infections and more than 11300 deaths according to the World Health Organization In May 2018 the DRC reported an Ebola outbreak located in quateur Province in the northwest of the country As of May 20 health officials have reported 51 probable or confirmed cases and 27 deaths There are currently no licensed treatments available for Ebola virus disease although multiple experimental therapies are being developedWe hope this trial will establish the safety of this experimental treatment for Ebola virus disease  an important first step in a larger evaluation process said NIAID Director Anthony S Fauci MD Ebola is highly lethal and reports of another outbreak in the DRC remind us that we urgently need Ebola treatmentsThis study adds to NIAID efforts in conducting scientifically and ethically sound biomedical research to develop countermeasures against Ebola virus disease added Dr FauciMAb114 is a monoclonal antibody  a protein that binds to a single target on a pathogen  isolated from a human survivor of the 1995 Ebola outbreak in Kikwit a city in the DRC Nancy Sullivan PhD chief of the Biodefense Research Section in NIAIDs Vaccine Research Center VRC and her team in collaboration with researchers from the National Institute of Biomedical Research INRB in the DRC and the Institute for Biomedical Research in Switzerland discovered that the survivor retained antibodies against Ebola 11 years after infection They isolated the antibodies and tested the most favorable ones in the laboratory and nonhuman primate studies and selected mAb114 as the most promising Professor JeanJacques Muyembe director general of INRB and one of the scientists involved in the original detection of the Ebola virus in 1976 played a key role in discovering mAb114In collaboration with the VRC scientists at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College Hanover New Hampshire illustrated that the monoclonal antibody binds to the hardtoreach core of the Ebola virus surface protein and blocks the proteins interaction with its receptor on human cells A single dose of mAb114 protected nonhuman primates days after lethal Ebola virus infection The antibody was developed in partnership with the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency It was manufactured for clinical studies by the company MedImmune based in Gaithersburg MarylandThe discovery and development of this experimental Ebola treatment was a collaborative process made possible by Ebola survivors and the DRC scientists who first

1806,1993,"""Sept 2 2021  Shawn Farash says he questions everything and loves learning about the human body When reports of a new virus began circulating he became fascinated and began his research A lifelong New Yorker and the founder of Loud Majority a conservative grassroots movement based in Long Island Farash 30 says he is unvaccinated and doesnt feel like he needs to be due to natural antibodies from having previously been infected with COVID19 Someone like myself will not just take someones word for it and go he says I want to see evidence I want to see science I want to see something factually backed up factually bolstered Farash is part of the segment of the US population whose trust in the many top health experts has dwindled Much of the problem started in early 2020 during the oftencontroversial White House COVID19 press briefings as experts tried to understand the science of the new virus with the latest information Farash says shifting recommendations for pandemic safety measures among other concerns about health experts transparency on information surrounding the virus and its effects ultimately led to confusion and then doubts on the science behind COVID19 safety mandates He along with many who share similar views would have preferred if health experts were more vocal about their uncertainty he says Youre being told by experts at the first part of this This is a very dangerous virus This is a brand new virus We dont know much about it But we do know that you have to do ABCDEFG to keep yourself safe Farash says But how could that be true if you dont know much about the virus Health experts must be very cautious particularly in the early stages because conflicting arguments can easily lead to confusion or people choosing what to believe based on whats closest to their own beliefs says Thomas E Patterson PhD the Bradlee professor of Government and the Press at the Harvard Kennedy School in Cambridge MassachusettsIf theyre a little bit in the speculative realm and they put out something that they later have to retract the truth never catches up Patterson says So I do think its incumbent on those who are in positions of authority in the case of a public health issue to make sure that theyve got their facts straight at the beginning But the news media also plays a role in mixed messaging surrounding COVID19 according to Todd Gitlin PhD professor of journalism and sociology and chair of the PhD program in communications at Columbia University in New York City This is largely due to some journalists not being fully knowledgeable in scientific analysis Being wellversed before making scientific announcements is critical particularly with a virus like COVID19 he says The evolution of the virus is unfolding in real time Gitlin says If you were simply reporting the daytoday sort of state of belief in what would be effective against the virus or even about the danger of the virus itself you would be tracing a zigzag line which could be quite confusing Brooke Elliott 29 is unvaccinated and has also greatly lost trust in many of the countrys leading health experts and institutions as well as much of the media From Virginia she had gone back to school prior to the pandemic but is now caring for her young child at home for the time being Like Farash she also has recovered from COVID and feels her natural antibodies are now sufficient protection from reinfection or serious illness Elliott says her doubts began to rise in late 2020 when information on COVID19 and vaccines fully transformed from right and wrong to right and left specifically partisan politics There was just a growing pattern of inconsistencies Elliott says The politicization of COVID started to kind of emerge more and more I think with it being an election year candidates kind of pull from anything and everything to make it take on a different political nature as well I think that bias kind of began to creep up Is this 100 about COVID now or is this kind of becoming something else or is there a dual purposeEarly in the pandemic there was a generally high amount of trust in both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Dr Anthony Fauci says Liz Hamel vice president and director of the Public Opinion and Survey Research Program at Kaiser Family Foundation Over time that total trust has eroded but has really diverged along partisan lines with republican trust dropping rapidly Hamel says This pattern could lead to problems if there are future public health crises or pandemics she says I think to the extent that politics continues to be a factor in how we handle public health it will continue Hamel says However there are ways to possibly combat this issue One thing I would say that weve learned in our research is that people trust individual healthcare providers at this point much more than they trust sort of national or even local public health messengers Hamel says I think people are more likely to be open to considering information that conflicts with their preconceived notions when it comes from their own healthcare providers than when it comes from a talking head on TV But political leaders can also play a role in restoring trust particularly when choosing to stand behind public health experts says Shanto Iyengar PhD professor of political science and director of the political communication laboratory at Stanford University Decades of research demonstrates that the public follows the views of their preferred leaders Iyengar says Elliott says the pandemic has caused her to view the world through a new set of eyes She now operates with a sliding scale of skepticism vs confident trust of any particular person or source Many who have similar distrust would likely be more understanding of inconsistencies from health experts if reactions to their uncertainty werent so harsh Elliott says That curiosity and asking those questions instead of being a natural and welcomed response has received huge amounts of criticism and has been censored in many cases That starts to raise more suspicions she saysFor instance a sizeable portion of unvaccinated adults have doubts about the science surrounding COVID19 vaccines specifically Because its possible this group could become more open to getting the vaccine some messaging can be counterproductive according to Gitlin I think simply preaching to people sermonizing and beating up on people who are resistant to vaccination is probably not effective Gitlin says Maybe the people who are resistant I think are already resentful of being talked down to and suspicious of government interventions Its also important to remember that people choose to remain unvaccinated for various reasons Gitlin says For example this can be seen in vaccine hesitancy among Black Americans that largely stems from the infamous Tuskegee Study that spanned from the early 1930s to the 1970s Black men who were told they were receiving syphilis treatment werent treated and instead studied to understand progressive effects of the disease which resulted in many preventable deaths But we also know that there are people whose resistance is simply out of suspicion of all establishments especially medical establishments media establishments political corporate Gitlin says Farash says that he hopes his trust in health experts and institutions will be restored But first the publics trust in each other needs mending Do you know how many times Ive been told that because Im asking questions Im putting peoples lives at risk Farash says I dont think thats appropriate I just want answers I want to know what were doing I want to know why the rules are what they are Why is the speed limit 60 miles an hour in Upstate New York but only 55 miles an hour in Long Island""",WebMD,real,0,1806

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID part of NIHMost people are infected with RSV by age 2 and undergo repeated infections throughout life Infected adults and children generally experience mild coldlike symptoms that resolve within a week or two However infection can cause severe lower respiratory tract disease including pneumonia and bronchiolitis among premature infants children younger than age 2 with heart or lung problems children and adults with weakened immune systems and the elderly About 2 percent of RSVinfected infants under 1 year of age require hospitalization Children between ages 1 and 5 years and adults older than 65 years are also at higher risk of hospitalizationEach year on average in the United States RSV leads to 57527 hospitalizations and 21 million outpatient visits among children younger than 5 years and 177000 hospitalizations and 14000 deaths among adults older than 65 years according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Globally RSV infections are estimated to cause more than 250000 deaths each yearCurrently no vaccine to prevent RSV infection or drug to treat it is available The monoclonal

underappreciated as a major cause of illness and death not only in infants and children but also in people with weakened immune systems and the elderly said NIAID Director Anthony S Fauci MD A vaccine to reduce the burden of this important disease is badly neededThe study called VRC 317 will enroll healthy adults ages 1850 years Participants will be randomly assigned to receive two injections in the arm at 12 weeks apart with either the investigational vaccine or the investigational vaccine adjuvanted with alum Alum is a chemical compound commonly added to vaccines to enhance the bodys immune responseParticipants will also be randomly assigned to receive one of three vaccine doses 50 micrograms 150 micrograms or 500 micrograms at both vaccination time points Initially five people will be vaccinated with the 50 microgram dose If the initial group of participants experience no serious adverse reactions attributable to the vaccine the study team will then begin to vaccinate participants at the next dosage level They will repeat this stepwise process until they administer the 500 microgram doseParticipants will return for 12 clinic visits over 44 weeks after the first injection At these visits study clinicians will conduct physical exams and collect blood samples They will also test mucous samples from volunteers mouths and noses to measure the immune responses generatedThe study is being led by principal investigator Michelle C Crank MD head of the Translational Sciences Core in the Viral Pathogenesis Laboratory part of NIAIDs Vaccine Research Center VRC Study clinicians will conduct a daily safety review of any new clinical information and a Protocol Safety Review Team will examine trial safety data weekly to ensure the vaccine meets safety standardsThe investigational vaccine called DSCav1 results from years of research led by Barney S Graham MD PhD deputy VRC director and Peter D Kwong PhD chief of the Structural Biology Section and the Structural Bioinformatics Core at the VRC The vaccine candidate is a single structurallyengineered protein from the surface of RSV rather than a more traditional approach based on a weakened or inactivated whole virus In 2013 VRC scientists tested several versions of the protein as a vaccine in mice and nonhuman primates The protein variants elicited high levels of neutralizing antibodies and protected the animals against RSV infection Drs Graham and Kwong selected the most promising candidate DSCav1 for clinical evaluationThis work represents an example of how new biological insights from basic research can lead to candidate vaccines for diseases of public health importance and the value of multidisciplinary research teams like the ones assembled at the VRC said Dr GrahamThe trial is

identify with racial or ethnic groups that have historically been underrepresented in research This data will enable researchers to address yet unanswerable questions about health and disease leading to new breakthroughs and advancing discoveries to reduce persistent health disparitiesUntil now over 90 of participants from large genomics studies have been of European descent The lack of diversity in research has hindered scientific discovery said Josh Denny MD chief executive officer of the All of Us Research Program All of Us participants are leading the way toward more equitable representation in medical research through their involvement And this is just the beginning Over time as we expand our data and add new tools this dataset will become an indispensable resource for health researchThe genomic data is available via a cloudbased platform the All of Us Researcher Workbench and also includes genotyping arrays from 165000 participants Whole genome sequencing provides information about almost all of an individuals genetic makeup while genotyping arrays the more commonly used genetic testing approach capture a specific subset of the genomeIn addition to the genomic data the Workbench contains information from many of the participants electronic health records Fitbit devices and survey responses The platform also links to data from the Census Bureaus American Community Survey to provide more details about the communities where participants live This combination of data will allow researchers to better understand how genes can cause or influence diseases in the context of other health determinants The ultimate goal is to enable more precise approaches to health care for all populations To protect participants privacy the program has removed all direct identifiers from the data and upholds strict requirements for researchers seeking accessThere is a unique depth and dimensionality to the All of Us platform that sets it apart from other resources in the field Its also designed with team science in mind allowing researchers to explore topics in an open and collaborative way said Gail Jarvik MD PhD head of the Division of Medical Genetics at the

from several treatment arms or substudies of the trial The new results offer findings of interest for future cancer research that could ultimately play a role in bringing targeted treatments to patients with certain gene abnormalities regardless of their cancer typeFindings from three arms were released at this years American Society of Clinical Oncology ASCO annual meeting in Chicago adding to findings from one arm released in November 2017 The study was codeveloped by NCI part of the National Institutes of Health and the ECOGACRIN Cancer Research Group part of the NCIsponsored National Clinical Trials Network NCTN ECOGACRIN and NCI are coleading the trialThe outcomes data being released today from this groundbreaking precision medicine trial are an exciting step for NCIMATCH said Lyndsay Harris MD of NCIs Cancer Diagnosis Program and NCI study chair These findings represent a large collection of data in populations of patients who may not have been studied in conventional clinical trials and they will have important implications for future precision medicine trialsNCIMATCH a phase 2 clinical trial seeks to determine whether targeted therapies for people whose tumors have certain gene mutations will be effective regardless of their cancer type Researchers use a DNA sequencing test to identify gene mutations in patients tumors The test looks for mutations in 143 genes associated with cancer that can be targeted by one of the drugs being studied in the trial The trial launched in August 2015 and has nearly 40 treatment arms each of which aims to enroll at least 35 patients whose tumors have a specific genetic change As the first findings are released at ASCO many other arms are still enrolling patients and several additional arms are in development for possible opening later in 2018NCIMATCH represents the first attempt to systematically leverage nextgeneration sequencing to explore so many therapies in parallel said ECOGACRIN study chair Keith T Flaherty MD a medical oncologist at Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center in Boston By focusing our investigational effort on new biomarkerguided therapies in understudied cancer types we have accelerated the opportunity to find signals of efficacyThe study is a signalfinding trial meaning that treatments that show promise can advance to larger more definitive studies outside of the trial NCIMATCH is for adults who have solid tumors lymphoma or myeloma that have progressed on standard treatment or rare cancers for which there is no standard treatment A goal of the study was for about 25 percent of patients in the trial to have rare cancers Surprisingly 625 percent of the first 6000 patients enrolled in NCIMATCH had tumors other than the four most common cancers breast colorectal nonsmall cell lung and prostate providing more opportunities for less common and rare tumors than expected based on initial estimatesThe first arm for which results were released Arm Z1D in November 2017 at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer annual meeting showed that the drug nivolumab has promising activity in mismatch repairdeficient noncolorectal cancersHighlights from the findings from the three arms announced at ASCO include Arm I studied the drug taselisib in 65 patients with mutations in the PIK3CA gene There were no objective responses to the drug meaning the tumors did not shrink substantially However 24 percent of the patients had progressionfree survival  or prolonged stable disease  of greater than six months This prolonged stable disease was seen even in patients with aggressive cancer types including lung cancer and cholangiocarcinoma bile duct cancer The observation of prolonged disease control in these cancer types suggests the drug warrants further research In Arm Q the drug adotrastuzumab emtansine TDM1 was studied in patients with HER2overexpressing tumors excluding breast and gastricgastroesophageal junction cancers Partial responses at least 30 percent shrinkage of the tumor were seen in three of the 37 patients each of whom had a rare cancer mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the parotid gland squamous cell cancer of the parotid gland and extramammary Paget disease of the scrotum In addition 46 percent of the patients had stable disease including patients with ovarian uterine and colorectal cancers The researchers concluded that the findings warrant further study particularly in certain rare cancers Arm W tested the drug AZD4547 in 50 patients with mutations in the FGFR pathway Ten percent of patients had a partial response Among four patients who had a partial response whose tumors all had different sites of origin two had point mutations in the FGFR23 gene and the other two had FGFR3 gene fusions in which part of the FGFR gene is joined to part of another gene This suggests that these mutations may be particularly sensitive to the drug warranting further studies in tumors harboring these fusionsMany of the patients in these three arms had been treated with more than three lines of therapy before entering the trial Arm I 37 percent Arm Q 33 percent Arm W 50 percent so the results are particularly encouraging It suggests that future studies in populations with earlierstage disease could potentially see more responsesResults of additional treatment arms that have completed accrual will be released on a rolling

only exposed in the first trimester of pregnancy according to a new study supported by the National Institutes of HealthSIDS is the sudden unexplained death of an infant under 1 year of age Many studies have shown that the risk of SIDS is increased by maternal smoking during pregnancy Some studies have also found that prenatal alcohol exposure particularly from heavy drinking during pregnancy can increase SIDS risk Now the NIHfunded Safe Passage Study provides a look at how SIDS risk is influenced by the timing and amount of prenatal exposure to tobacco and alcohol A report of the study appears in EclinicalMedicine an online journal published by The LancetOurs is the first largescale prospective study to closely investigate the association between prenatal alcohol and tobacco exposure and the risk of SIDS said first author Amy J Elliott PhD of the Avera Health Center for Pediatric  Community Research in Sioux Falls South Dakota Our findings suggest that combined exposures to alcohol and tobacco have a synergistic effect on SIDS risk given that dual exposure was associated with substantially higher risk than either exposure aloneTo conduct the study a multicenter team of scientists from throughout the US and in South Africa formed the Prenatal Alcohol in SIDS and Stillbirth PASS Network From 2007 until 2015 PASS Network researchers followed the outcomes of nearly 12000 pregnancies among women from two residential areas in Cape Town South Africa and five sites in the US including two American Indian Reservations in South Dakota and North Dakota The study sites were selected for their high rates of prenatal alcohol use and SIDS and to include populations where the ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in SIDS remains understudiedThe researchers determined oneyear outcomes for about 94 of the pregnancies They found that 66 infants died during that time including 28 SIDS deaths and 38 deaths from known causes In addition to the almost 12fold increased SIDS risk from combined smoking and drinking beyond the first trimester of pregnancy they determined that the risk of SIDS was increased fivefold in infants whose mothers reported they continued smoking beyond the first trimester and fourfold in infants whose mothers reported they continued drinking beyond the first trimester These risks were in comparison to infants who were either not exposed to tobacco or alcohol during gestation or whose mothers quit tobacco or alcohol use by the end of the first trimesterThe Safe Passage Study provides important new information about the role of dual exposures to prenatal smoking and drinking as risk factors for SIDS said cofirst author Hannah C Kinney MD of the Department of Pathology at Boston Childrens Hospital and Harvard School of Medicine Our findings support the current recommendation of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the US Surgeon General and the World Health Organization that women not drink or smoke during pregnancy and emphasizes the significance of dual exposure which provides the greatest risk for infant mortalityIn a joint statement the leaders of the NIH institutes that provide primary funding for the Safe Passage Study saidThese findings provide still more evidence of the vital importance of the early prenatal environment to healthy postnatal outcomes Insofar as many women quit drinking and smoking only after they learn that they are pregnant this study argues strongly for screening for substance use early in pregnancy and intervening as soon as possible It also calls for stronger public health messaging regarding the dangers of drinking and smoking during pregnancy and among women who plan to become pregnantDiana W Bianchi MD Director Eunice Kennedy Shriver National

the triple vaccinated population in England over the past couple of months whilst declining drastically among the unvaccinated populationWith the most recent figures showing the vaccinated population in England accounted for a shocking 94 of all Covid19 Deaths in April and May and 90 of those deaths were among the triplequadruple vaccinated populationLets not lose touchYour Government and Big Tech are actively trying to censor the information reported by The Expos to serve their own needs Subscribe now to make sure you receive the latest uncensored news in your inboxFollow The Exposs Official Channel on Telegram hereJoin the conversation in our Telegram Discussion Group hereOn the 7th July Boris Johnson the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom announced he was resigning Since then the Mainstream Media in the UK have distracted the public with 247 news on that announcement and speculation on who could replace himIts times like these that you ought to watch what bad news is being quietly published in the background in the hope that it wont receive much attention and it just so happens that hours before Boris announced his resignation his Government published new data that proves things have been terrible for the vaccinated population in England over the past couple of monthsBack in March 2022 the UK Health Security Agency announced that from April 1st 2022 they would no longer publish the vaccination status of Covid19 cases hospitalisations and deaths in EnglandAt the time the UKHSA claimed this was because the UK Government had ended free universal Covid19 testing and this therefore affected their ability to robustly monitor Covid19 cases by vaccination statusHowever this was a lieThe UK Health Security Agency had been looking for an excuse for months to stop publishing the data because it clearly showed the vaccinated population were suffering immense immune system damage with case hospitalisation and death rates per 100000 highest among the fully vaccinated populationThe following chart shows the real world Covid19 vaccine effectiveness among the triple vaccinated population in England in the Week 3 Week 7 and Week 13 UKHSA Vaccine Surveillance reports of 2022 This was nowhere near the claimed 95 effectiveness by Pfizer was itBut now we have more evidence to both prove the UKHSA was lying and that the current mainstream media storm surrounding the resignation of Boris Johnson is just a distractionThis is because another UK Government agency known as the Office for National Statistics ONS has just published data on deaths by vaccination statusThe latest dataset from the ONS is titled Deaths by Vaccination Status England 1 January 2021 to 31 May 2022 and it can be accessed on the ONS site here and downloaded hereTable 1 of the latest dataet contains figures on the mortality rates by vaccination status for all cause deaths deaths involving Covid19 and deaths not involving Covid19 And it is here that we are able to ascertain the vaccination status of everyone who has died of Covid19 since the beginning of April 2022 when the UKHSA claimed they could no longer reliably report the figuresHeres how the ONS presents the figures for the month of April 2022 Source  Table 1Weve taken the figures provided by the ONS for both April and May 2022 and produced the following chart showing Covid19 deaths by vaccination status in England between 1st April and 31st May 2022 In all according to the ONS there were 4935 Covid19 deaths over these two months and the vaccinated population accounted for a shocking 4647 of those deaths But whats even more shocking is that the triple vaccinated accounted for 4216 of those deaths with just 288 deaths recorded among the unvaccinated populationIn March 2022 there were 321 Covid19 deaths within 60 days of a positive test among the unvaccinated population according to the UKHSA Week 13 Vaccine Surveillance Report as detailed in the following chart using data extracted from table 13b of the report This means there were 33 less deaths among the unvaccinated over two months April and May than there were in the whole of MarchUnfortunately the opposite is true for the vaccinated population especially the triple vaccinated There were 911 more deaths among the vaccinated over two months and 1161 more death among the triple vaccinatedThis means deaths have fallen drastically among the unvaccinated but increased significantly among the vaccinated population since the UKHSA claimed they could no longer reliably publish the dataThe following chart shows the percentage of Covid19 deaths by vaccination status in England between 1st April and 31st May 2022 according to the latest ONS dataset published just hours before Boris Johnsons resignation The quietly published figures reveal that the vaccinated population as a whole accounted for a shocking 94 of all Covid19 deaths in April and May 2022 with the unvaccinated accounting for just 6 of all Covid19 deaths But the most horrific statistic here is that 90 of the deaths among the vaccinated were among people who had been given at least three doses of a Covid19 injectionHowever many in the UK have been given a fourth dose of a Covid19 injection since the spring and judging by the latest data from the Government of Cananda its likely many of those deaths could actually be among the quadruple vaccinatedThe most recent Government of Canada figures show that there were 521 Covid19 deaths between 6th and 12th June and the vaccinated population accounted for 485 of them with a shocking 242 deaths among the quadruple vaccinated population meaning they accounted for 50 of Covid19 deaths among the vaccinated in the second week of June 2022These arent the kind of figures you would expect to see if the Covid19 injections really are up to 95 effective at preventing death are theySo there you have it whilst youve been distracted by Boris Johnsons resignation as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom the UK Government quietly published a report just hours before his announcement containing data they previously claimed they didnt have which confirmed the vaccinated now account for 94 of Covid19 deaths in England and 90 of those deaths are among the triple vaccinatedWith news like this being swept under the rug by the mainstream media it makes you wonder what else they will attempt to

1266,380,"""Feb 16 2023  A highly infectious strain of bird flu  known as H5N1 is sweeping across the globe devastating backyard flocks and commercial farms alike While this virus mostly infects birds growing reports of mammals infected with the virus have some experts worried The main concern they say is as H5N1 continues to spread and multiply in different species there are more opportunities for the virus to potentially gain mutations that could help it more easily infect humans Just by the sheer numbers game the more chances it has to infect humans or other mammals the more chance youre going to get that rare event happening says Richard Webby PhD the director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds at St Jude Childrens Hospital in Memphis Since May 2022 the US Department of Agriculture has detected 121 mammals infected with the H5N1 virus including red foxes skunks bears and even seals In October 2022 an outbreak at a mink farm in Spain resulted in the culling of over 51000 animals and earlier this month Peru confirmed 585 sea lions had died from the virus in coastal nature preserves While H5N1 infections have been detected in mammals over the past 25 years were certainly seeing an uptick in reported cases over the past 12 months Webby says The World Health Organization has stated that the risk to humans remains low but we cannot assume that will remain the case and we must prepare for any change in the status quo WHO DirectorGeneral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus PhD said at a news briefing this month H5N1 infections in humans are rare They mostly happen when someone has unprotected direct exposure to birds infected with H5N1 or surfaces contaminated with the virus Since 1997 there have been about 870 human cases reported to the WHO with roughly half dying from the infection Even if someone is infected with the virus it is even rarer that the infection would spread to another humanH5N1 viruses currently circulating in wild birds and causing poultry outbreaks are welladapted to spread among birds Tim Uyeki MD chief medical officer of the Influenza Divisions Office of the Director at the CDC said in an online QA However these H5N1 bird flu viruses do not have the ability to easily bind to receptors in the upper respiratory tract of humans or to transmit among people Even with the recordbreaking numbers of infected wild birds and poultry human infections have become rarer in the last few years Since the beginning of this century it was not uncommon to have at least 30 to 40 recorded human H5N1 per year Since 2021 there have been fewer than 10 infections reported around the world according to the CDC H5N1 infections in wild mammals are not unheard of though they are also rare events Most of these cases likely occur when an animal eats an infected bird and is exposed to the virus Like in humans these infections have been sporadic But a report last month about an outbreak at a mink farm in Spain caused experts to worry as the researchers suggested the virus may have spread by one mink infecting others Minks are related to ferrets which scientists use as an animal model for studying flu transmission If we see something that transmits in mink its not a stretch to think Maybe that is something that could also transmit in ferrets Webby says We certainly would use transmission in ferrets as an alarm bell for human risk But so far there is no evidence that the virus has picked up the ability to more easily infect humans says William Schaffner MD a professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville In fact one of the reassuring things is in that mink farm in Spain the people who work on the farm  and had very close contact with those mink  were all tested and they were found to be negative he says The minks were also very closely confined in cages  which may have aided spread of the virus he notesThe more recent report of infections in sea lions had some people speculating online about possible spread of the virus among the animals but these marine mammals may have also been exposed to birds infected with H5N1 What is clear is that the virus is widespread and is popping up in more and more animals says Jennifer Nuzzo DrPH who heads the Pandemic Center at the Brown University School of Public Health in Providence RI Why that is happening is less obvious Does that mean that H5N1 has gained some fitness to mammals What does that mean for the potential to infect humans We just dont know she says Will Bird Flu Become the Next Pandemic Unfortunately its not possible to predict what type of virus will cause the next pandemic But the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System is already hard at work monitoring influenza strains around the world Schaffner says  Its like a radar system trying to detect the enemy as early as possible he says The network not only tracks infections in humans but also in birds and other animals If the bird flu did begin to pose a real threat to the public the US already has a stockpile of bird flu vaccines If we need them they can be updated to the latest strain and immediately start to be manufactured Schaffner says While experts agree that the publics risk for H5N1 is low people should avoid contact

microbiota transplants by enema to cure C diff infectionsClostridium difficile commonly referred to as C diff is a bacterium that infects the colon and can cause diarrhea fever and abdominal pain CDAD most commonly occurs in hospitalized older adults who have recently taken antibiotics However cases of CDAD can occur outside of healthcare settings as well Although antibiotics often cure the infection C diff can cause potentially lifethreatening colon inflammationPeople with CDAD usually are treated with a course of antibiotics such as oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin However CDAD returns in approximately 20 percent of people who receive such treatment according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDCMultiple research studies have indicated that FMT is an effective method for curing patients with repeat C diff infections However the longterm safety of FMT has not been established Although more research is needed to determine precisely how FMT effectively cures recurrent CDAD the treatment appears to rapidly restore a healthy and diverse gut microbiome in recipientsPhysicians perform FMT using various routes of administration including oral pills upper gastrointestinal endoscopy colonoscopy and enema The new NIAIDsupported trial aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of FMT delivered by enema to patients with recurrent CDAD The trial is part of an effort to gather data on how best to standardize the FMT processNadine Rouphael MD associate professor Division of Infectious Diseases at Emory University is the principal investigator for the trial Volunteers will be enrolled in the trial after completing a standard course of antibiotics for a recurrent CDAD episode presuming their diarrhea symptoms cease on treatment They will be randomly assigned to one of two groups The first group 108 people will take an antidiarrheal medication and receive a stool transplant FMT delivered by retention enema The second group 54 people will take an antidiarrheal medication and receive a placebo solution delivered by retention enema The placebo is saline that has been colored so that it appears identical to the active stool transplant product The trial is partially blinded so that the participant and the investigators involved in the study will not know who is assigned to which groupParticipants in either group who have diarrhea with stools that test positive for C diff shortly after the enema will receive an active stool transplant for a maximum of two FMTs If participants in either group have another C diff infection after receiving two FMTs they will be referred to other locally available treatment optionsAll participants will provide stool samples and blood samples at designated time points for one year from the date of their effective treatment for CDAD or from the date of their last treatment if it was unsuccessful Investigators will evaluate the stool specimens for changes in gut microbial diversity and infectious pathogens and will examine the blood samples for metabolic syndrome markersTo learn more about the longterm outcomes of FMT all participants will be monitored for adverse side effects for three years after completing treatment for recurrent CDAD Investigators also will collect information on any new onset of CDAD related chronic medical conditions or any other serious health issues they may

1476,930,"""Oct 25 2022  When 32yearold Brittany Dicks was diagnosed with stage II triplenegative breast cancer in January 2022 she wasnt worried about the cost of treatment A medical assistant in Charleston SC Dicks had fulltime employment with health benefits But when she wasnt able to work for several months due to chemotherapy and its side effects Dicks lost her job Her health insurance coverage ended in May And although she filed for Medicaid at the beginning of June it wasnt approved until September Meanwhile Dicks still needed treatment She estimates that she ran up close to 20000 in medical debt while finishing chemotherapy during the 4 months she was uninsured The surgeon she had seen since her diagnosis dropped her as a patient when she could no longer pay her bills That left her delaying a muchneeded mastectomy I dont sleep at night says Dicks a single mom of two kids ages 3 and 11 Mentally Im drained Just because I have cancer doesnt mean the bills arent due every month As soon as she felt well enough over the summer she started working as a parttime delivery driver for DoorDash to help pay for food and gas But that was just a BandAid Even when her new insurance kicked in covering the costs of daily life remained a struggle Dicks is still in deep medical debt Medicaid has covered new medical expenses and she hopes it will reimburse her for the debt she incurred over the summer while she waited for her coverage to kick in So far though Medicaid has not touched her 20000 debt I fear that Im not going to be able to dig out of this hole she says Researchers who study the financial impacts of cancer have a term for Dickss experience Financial toxicity Its a catchall term for the burden many Americans with cancer have Financial toxicity is a multidimensional concept Theres both a material burden and a psychosocial one says Grace Li Smith MD PhD a radiation oncologist at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in HoustonFinancial toxicity consists of the direct costs of medical care including copays deductibles and other outofpocket expenses for treatment and medications as well as the indirect costs from loss of income or savings that come with cancer care Researchers are also now beginning to understand the psychological effects these financial burdens can have on patients and their families Financial toxicity is not unique to the patient says Li Smith It very directly impacts the whole family or household Early in her career Li Smith was already seeing how her patients worries extended beyond their physical disease One of her first patients told her their greatest worry wasnt whether the treatment would work or what physical toxicity to expect it was how they would pay for their care There was much more anxiety and true distress about the financial burden than about the treatment itself Li Smith says This fear about the costs of cancer care is wellfounded In the United States cancer treatment costs reached an estimated 150 billion in 2020 and continue to rise Patients shoulder a significant portion of that burden  with one study estimating that patients paid 21 billion for their cancer care in 2019 The burden is often made worse by decreased income Between 40 and 85 of patients with cancer needed to take time off work or quit their jobs during treatment And for those like Dicks who find themselves with no insurance outofpocket costs can quickly skyrocket In fact one study of newly diagnosed cancer patients over age 50 reported that more than 42 of patients fully depleted their financial assets and around 30 incurred debt by the second year of their diagnosis Younger adults may be even more financially vulnerable A study of patients in Washington state found that those under 65  who represent about half of cancer cases were 2 to 5 times more likely to declare bankruptcy than patients over 65 In another study published last July Li Smith and colleagues found that younger patients ages 18 to 64 had more money troubles which meant less money for food more problems with staying on their medications as well as greater distress and anxiety overall In fact younger adults were over 45 more likely to face severe financial toxicity compared with older adults and about 4 times more likely to have severe psychological effects from this burdenThe distress if left unchecked can spiral out of control Molly MacDonald had just gone through a financially devastating divorce in 2005 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer Recently out of work MacDonald ended up with COBRA insurance  a federal law that allows people to stay on their former employers health plan temporarily but they have to pay the full cost themselves She was dealing with a 1300 monthly premium meaning the mother of five had no financial safety net She risked having her car repossessed and her utilities shut off I gave tentative thought to how I could take my life and make it look like an accident says MacDonald of Bloomfield Hills MI I thought the kids would be better off without me For some the loss of income can be even more worrisome than the medical bills Some patients may go back to work during treatment often against medical advice When Stephanie Caputo 43 of Monroe NJ began treatment for stage III breast cancer in 2021 her doctor recommended she stop working Treatment would make her immunocompromised and her job in a medical clinic could expose her to harmful germs including the coronavirus Caputo went on disability and received 900 every 2 weeks But that wasnt enough to pay her mortgage let alone cover her other monthly expenses as a single mother of four teenagers After finishing chemotherapy and during radiation she went back to work parttime against her doctors advice My doctor is telling me I cant work but I also cant have my house go into default Caputo says But being on her feet through 12hour shifts made treatment side effects especially back and joint pain kick into overdrive The physicality of my job was really difficult to tolerate she says The physical burden was too great to take on more work but the extra money also wasnt enough to keep her afloat Fortunately her brother stepped in and covered 6 months of her mortgage paymentsAlthough financial toxicity research to date has largely focused on the patient researchers are also starting to understand that family members and caregivers often share in the burden We are just at the beginning of realizing that this is a real problem says Fumiko Chino MD a radiation oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City Chino and colleagues recently showed that family members of patients with cancer were more likely to delay or forgo medical care than family members of people without cancer The study published in July found the effect was greatest among family members of younger adults with cancer The caregiver and family burden related to cancer diagnosis and treatment is really underappreciated says Chino Family members and caregivers are neglecting their own health concerns passing up career opportunities struggling with financial concerns Chino speaks from personal experience When her fianc later her husband was diagnosed with neuroendocrine carcinoma in 2005 Chino quit her job as art director at a television production company to take care of him The couple both in their 20s struggled to afford his care Chino put her own dental medical and mental health care on hold She never for instance went to physical therapy to address injuries she got from sleeping in hospital chairs and moving around her husband who was over 6 feet tall At one point she walked with a limp Chinos husband passed away in 2007 and even 15 years later her injury from sleeping in hospital chairs remains a significant physical burden she says But like many caregivers I wasnt really thinking about my own health Danielle Hadfield 35 an ER nurse in Rochester NY also delayed her own care when her mom got sick She quit her job shortly after her mom was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma in August 2020 Hadfield knew her mom who lived 35 hours away in Albany NY would need a lot of care in the upcoming months I knew this was going to be the last year or so of her life and I wanted to be there for her she saysWhen Hadfield quit her job she and her husband  who was selfemployed  purchased health insurance coverage through the New York State Marketplace The monthly insurance payments for Hadfield who was pregnant with her second child her husband and their toddler cost as much as the familys monthly mortgage payments In addition to providing child care for her young daughter and making frequent trips to Albany Hadfield began a side business as a legal nurse consultant working mostly at night to replace part of her lost income During this time she began to have pain attacks that would migrate through her body along with tongue and facial numbness that came and went She ignored these health issues for nearly a year until after her mom died in November 2021 Only after her mother passed away did Hadfield begin seeking answers to her own pain In September 2022 she finally got them She had a nerve condition called small fiber sensory neuropathy But even with a diagnosis she is still facing more tests to root out the cause and understand the best treatment What can doctors do to help patients and families at risk for financial toxicity Specific ways to deal with financial toxicity do not exist in most professional guidelines nor are there standard screening tools to identify it says Li Smith These gaps put pressure on doctors to ask about financial barriers and concerns but most do not know how to broach the topic or how to help Physicians may not know how to fix the problem or what resources exist Li Smith says Patients and family members on the other hand are often reluctant to bring up cost with doctors Some may be ashamed to talk about their financial problems while others may fear doing so will prevent them from being offered the best possible treatments says MacDonald the mother of five who thought about taking her own life But experts say financial toxicity needs to be dealt with headon That means involving financial navigators or counselors and social workers who can for instance help patients and families find financial support for their basic living expensesFrom a research perspective more clinical trials should include financial toxicity outcomes says Joshua Palmer MD a radiation oncologist at Ohio State University in Columbus Palmer and colleagues recently showed that the number of radiation therapy clinical trials including financial toxicity results increased significantly from 2001 to 2020 though the rate remains low Financial burden is part of the broader discussion about shared decision making says Palmer In shared decision making doctors discuss the risks and benefits of different treatment options empowering the patient to make an informed choice with the doctor What we want to avoid is patients feeling like they will get inferior care if they have financial barriers Palmer says And every little bit can help In 2006 MacDonald started the Pink Fund  a nonprofit to help patients with cancer cover nonmedical costofliving expenses Both Stephanie Caputo and Brittany Dicks received grants from the Pink Fund For Caputo the funds covered 2 months of car payments and for Dicks it covered 2 months of rent While the onetime grant was a big help said Dicks cancer is an

obesityrelated lung complications before her 35th birthday So she got the gastric sleeve And at first it seemed like the best decision for her and her family She was losing weight  100 pounds in 16 months  and so was her husband The whole family was more active and seemed to have more energy But then her husbands weight began to creep back up While she joined a running group and signed up for halfmarathons her husbands depression and drinking worsened The healthier lifestyle theyd shared was now an unspoken wedge between them And the added attention Kristal was getting from men and women because of her thinner size only added to the tension After 30 years together and 22 years of marriage the high school sweethearts divorced in June 2021 Kristals weight loss wasnt the only problem but she and her exhusband believe it was the beginning of the end New research from the University of Pittsburgh found that Kristals experience is a common one People who have bariatric surgery double their chances of marriage or divorce The study looked at data from 1441 bariatric surgery patients and found that nevermarried patients were over 50 more likely to get married and married patients were more than twice as likely to get divorced compared to the general US population This US data follows two Scandinavian studies from 2018 and 2020 that found similar relationship changes after bariatric surgery But the postsurgery divorce rate in the US was only about half that found in the Danish and Swedish studies according to the new study published in the journalAnnals of Surgery Its important to note that even with an increase in the divorce rate most marriages in the study were unchanged says epidemiologist and lead author Wendy King PhD In fact 81 of couples were still married 5 years after surgery But where the US population has a divorce rate of 35 bariatric patients in the study had an 8 divorce rate Likewise those whod never been married before the surgery had a marriage rate of 18 compared to 7 in the US populationSurgery certainly isnt a death sentence for a patients love life But the uptick in marriage and divorce suggests bariatric surgery significantly impacts how people engage in relationships It makes sense says clinical psychologist Rachel Goldman PhD assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry at NYU Grossman School of Medicine People are changing their lifestyle And those changes dont start or stop the day of surgery they begin as soon as someone decides to have surgery and continue as a lifelong process she says For some patients these healthy habits may offer a new lease on life says King the lead study author According to the study patients who had better physical health after surgery were more likely to get married But the continual lifestyle changes can also dramatically impact the rituals of existing relationships says Goldman who specializes in bariatric surgery cases Maybe a couple loved to go out and enjoy an extravagant meal before surgery or they had ice cream and watched a movie every Friday The habit changes that come with bariatric surgery can require one partner to focus less on those rituals These sorts of changes may leave one or both people feeling like their partner is turning away from them says Don Cole DMin a relationship therapist and clinical director at the Gottman Institute a think tank focused on the science of relationships The person who had surgery may feel unsupported in their new journey if their partner keeps advocating for unhealthy habits he says And the person who didnt have surgery may feel cast aside by their partners new health priorities Changes even those that are positive and healthy create a kind of crisis for relationships Cole says Its not just bariatric surgery Bringing a baby into the home infertility treatments and substance abuse recovery are all considered positive changes that are also predictors of relationship dissatisfaction and divorce he says A couple could have a range of emotions after one partner gets bariatric surgery Cole says Unfortunately my experience as a therapist says they arent that good at talking about it he saysBut bariatric surgery isnt the only thing at play in these relationship changes according to the study Interestingly married patients had a much lower chance of separation or divorce 13 than patients who were unmarried but living together 44 by 5 years after surgery Similarly most people who were already separated either got divorced or resumed being married Its as if the surgery and lifestyle changes served as a catalyst for people who already had one foot out of or in the door Goldman says A high sexual desire after surgery was also a predictor of divorce In fact there were more things before surgery that impacted divorce than surgeryrelated changes Its possible that many of these patients are on the path toward change already King says Who knows how much the surgery had to do with it Goldman recalls a patient who before surgery had a very low selfworth She wasnt satisfied with her relationship but admitted to staying because she didnt believe she could do any better than her current partner After surgery her perspective radically changed She started to get healthier invested in her education and changed jobs And when her partner refused to join her in making changes she left Maybe some of these patients were already thinking about leaving but just didnt have the confidence Goldman says Still its critical that patients receive more counseling on how choosing to have bariatric surgery can impact their relationship before and after their weight loss procedure King says It should be the standard of care Currently relationshipspecific counseling isnt required Goldman says Most programs do require a psychosocial evaluation before surgery but they are quite varied And even in programs where relationships are mentioned there often isnt a psychologist or licensed mental health professional on the team Since Kings previous research on substance abuse after bariatric surgery changed common practice in the field Goldman hopes this new data will have a similar influence and relationship counseling will become the normCole actually had bariatric surgery himself He recalls potential relationship issues were briefly mentioned Someone at the clinic said if his marriage felt challenged he should seek help from a professional and that was it For Cole there were unexpected negative feelings of shame and disappointment after surgery He felt the extreme weight loss was all his colleagues could talk about and was very disappointed when there was no change in his chronic pain a primary reason he had the procedure Fortunately he could talk to his wife who also happens to be a relationship therapist at Gottman about the range of emotions One of the things that we know that creates a deep sense of trust is when I know my partner is there for me when Im not well Cole says But these negative emotions can be the very things that feel most difficult to talk about or hear from a partner Its hard to share our own negative feelings and to hear someone elses Cole says He advises creating a new ritual of connection moments in time when you plan to turn toward one another That could be a daily walk where you intentionally talk about the surgeryrelated

overall cancer death rates continue to decline in men women and children in the United States in all major racial and ethnic groups Overall cancer incidence or rates of new cancers decreased in men and were stable in women from 1999 to 2014 In a companion study researchers reported that there has been an increase in incidence of latestage prostate cancer and that after decades of decline prostate cancer mortality has stabilizedThe annual report is a collaborative effort between the National Cancer Institute NCI part of the National Institutes of Health the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC the American Cancer Society and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries NAACCR The studies appeared online in Cancer on May 22 2018This years report is an encouraging indicator of progress were making in cancer research As overall death rates continue to decline for all major racial and ethnic groups in the United States its clear that interventions are having an impact said NCI Director Ned Sharpless MD The report also highlights areas where more work is needed With steadfast commitment to patients and their families we will be able to lower the mortality rates faster and improve the lives of those affected by cancerThe report includes mortality data through 2015 It shows that from 1999 to 2015 overall cancer death rates decreased by 18 percent per year among men and by 14 percent per year among women From 2011 to 2015 death rates decreased for 11 of the 18 most common cancer types in men and for 14 of the 20 most common cancer types in women Over the same period death rates for cancers of the liver pancreas and brain and other nervous system increased in both men and women death rates for cancer of the uterus increased in women and death rates for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx and soft tissue increased in men From 2010 to 2014 incidence rates decreased for seven of the 17 most common cancer types among men and for seven of the 18 most common cancer types among womenIn the companion study researchers explored prostate cancer trends in more detail They found that overall prostate cancer incidence rates declined an average of 65 percent each year between 2007 and 2014 from a rate of 163 new cases per 100000 men in the population in 2007 to 104 new cases per 100000 in 2014 However incidence of distant diseasethat is of cancer that has spread from the original tumor to other parts of the bodyincreased from a low rate of 78 new cases per 100000 in 2010 to 92 new cases per 100000 in 2014 Furthermore after two decades of decline between 1993 and 2013 prostate cancer mortality leveled off between 2013 and 2015 Although rates of distant disease increased in recent years there was no increase in the rates of cases with aggressive histologic grade Gleason score of 910This study also reports a decline in recent prostatespecific antigen PSA screening in the population based on a series of national surveys The reported decline in screening occurred between the 2010 and 2013 surveys for men between 50 and 74 years of age and after the 2008 survey for men age 75 and olderThe increase in latestage disease and the flattening of the mortality trend occurred contemporaneously with the observed decrease in PSA screening in the population said Serban Negoita MD DrPH of NCIs Surveillance Research Program and lead author of the prostate cancer report Although suggestive this observation does not demonstrate that one caused the other as there are many factors that contribute to incidence and mortality such as improvements in staging and treating cancer Additional research is needed to get a more comprehensive understanding of the recent trends and the possible relationship with PSA screening as well as the relationship with other factors that may be associated with these trendsFindings in the first part of the report show that incidence and death rates for all types of cancer combined were higher in men than in women in every racial and ethnic group For all cancer sites combined black men and white women had the highest incidence rates compared to other racial groups and black men and black women had the highest death rates compared to other racial groups NonHispanic men and women had higher incidence and death rates than those of Hispanic ethnicityThere continue to be significant declines in the cancer death rate with significant differences in rate by sex race and ethnicity said Otis W Brawley MD chief medical officer for ACS We need to continue working to understand the reasons for the disparities and how to most efficiently continue supporting and if possible accelerate these declinesThe report also describes fiveyear survival during 20072013 by cancer stage at diagnosis for four of the most common cancersfemale breast cancer colorectal cancer lung and bronchus cancer and melanoma of the skin While fiveyear survival is high for earlystage disease for breast cancer colorectal cancer and melanoma survival remains low for all stages of lung cancer ranging from 55 percent for Stage I to 4 percent for Stage IVThis report underscores that if cancer is caught early when it has the best chance of being treated patients can live longer said CDC Director Robert R Redfield MD Early detection and timely quality treatment are keys to saving livesIncreases in death rates for several cancers continue to cause concern Researchers suggest that the increase in liver cancer death rates is related to the high prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection among Baby Boomers as well as to the high prevalence of obesity in the United States Obesity is also thought to have contributed to the increase in death rates from cancers of the uterus and pancreas The recent increase in oral cavity and pharynx cancer death rates among white men is thought to be associated with human papillomavirus infectionIts encouraging to see progress in decreasing death rates for many types of cancer said Betsy A Kohler executive director NAACCR Yet the fact that death rates from several cancers are still on the rise means we need to keep working to find

around your forearm Cool right Now let it snap back Wait what do you mean your phone wont bend and stretch That little exercise in imagination illustrates whats possible in the realm of wearables  electronic devices we wear close to or on our skin Today smartwatches and phones are still hard inflexible blocks of plastic and metal Tomorrow all that will change In wearables flexibility stretchability and washability are all key requirements says Veena Misra PhD a professor of electrical engineering at North Carolina State University and director of the ASSIST Center a research institute funded by the National Science Foundation that develops wearables to aid health We are seeing these kinds of developments across the board Misra says and you can track that in the number of research papers coming out in wearables That number is just growing exponentially We tend to think of wearables as fun consumer gadgets but a growing school of thought says they will drastically improve health care  providing a vehicle for continuous longterm monitoring to predict adverse events and closely track disease improving treatments and health outcomes worldwide For that to happen wearables must work seamlessly with our bodies That means making conventionally hard rigid devices and systems more like human skin  soft bendable and stretchable How does one manage that By redesigning electronics at the molecular level miniaturizing sensors and creating unheardof power sources to support what engineers call a skinlike form factor To coin a phrase it aint science fiction Its happening as we speak and the new products these advances will create  potentially starting in health care and crossing over to the consumer wellness market  could become as normal as that clunky inflexible phone you cant put down Heres howA wearable that conforms to your body is better in two crucial ways Its less obtrusive for the user and it allows for a more reliable measurement Sensors and sensor systems a lot of times suffer from mechanical mismatch says Alper Bozkurt PhD an electrical engineer and Misras colleague at NC State and ASSIST If you have soft tissue thats moving around but a rigid sensing device thats not moving around your measurement may not be reliable Thats because all that extra banging around between the device and your body shows up as noise  meaningless information that can distort the measurement and may lead to false conclusions Then theres the human factor Bozkurt notes  the issue of compliance One of the challenges is we design things in the lab test everything and bring it to our medical operators and they raise their eyebrows and say No my patients are not going to wear this Bozkurt says You cannot imagine a future for wearables without solving the compliance issue People want a device thats comfortable doesnt stick out and requires little interaction Bozkurt says We call it wearandforget You might compare this to wearing a BandAid  sure you notice it occasionally but mostly it fades into the background without interfering with your daily tasks and without others even noticing its there A wristwatch may seem comfortable enough but applications extend beyond what a wristwatch can enable notes Michael Daniele PhD a fellow member of the NC State  ASSIST team who studies soft nanomaterials to engineer devices that monitor mimic or supplement body functions Wearable devices are being developed to help patients and even treat them in ways in which the patients comfort is a priority he says Take the use of electrodes and electronics in lowerlimb prosthetic sockets as an example he says Picture a few metal screws pressing into your limb that you are supporting all of your weight with or picture filling your shoe with an array of rocks Thats the state of wearables for such a userOK So How Do You Make Electronics Soft and Stretchy One way is to take hard things used to monitor health  like silicon chips  and make them so thin they become flexible Among the first to demonstrate this kind of material technology in skinlike wearable devices was John Rogers PhD in 2011 in a landmark Science paper titled Epidermal Electronics Wed been pretty active in that field for a number of years says Rogers who at the time was at the University of Illinois and has since moved to Northwestern University But then we realized that even silicon  which most people think of as a very rigid brittle rocklike material  can be made into forms and shapes and at thicknesses that allow it to be bent and  even stretched Rogers whose team has several applications in development uses an etching technique to shave off the surface of a semiconductor wafer It turns out all the action in those integrated circuits is happening on that verynearsurface layer he says All of the silicon underneath is just serving as a mechanical support That critical layer is then embedded into an elastic polymer matrix Rogers explains allowing them to design fully functioning systems that can bend twist and stretch Still others use a different approach building electronic parts from scratch out of materials that are inherently soft and stretchy  polymers This is the kind of work Stanford chemical engineer Zhenan Bao PhD does using a range of polymers with conducting properties In our work we gain a fundamental understanding on how to design plastic molecules so that they have the functions and properties we want Bao says For skinlike electronics the plastics are designed  on a molecular level  to be conductive elastic and soft One of the newest creations out of Baos lab is a polymer that lights up enabling skinlike visual displays She imagines a skin patch with the display right on it or going further a telehealth appointment where the doctor could see and feel the texture of the patients skin via a threedimensional lifelike display Example One exam to check for severe water retention in heart failure patients is to press on the skin to see if it bounces back Bao says The patient would wrap an electronic sticker around their leg and press on it to generate a display for the offsite doctor The doctor would be able to feel on the display the texture of the skin that the patient would feel she says  from a remote locationOf course this is still far away Bao notes But thats what I think would be possible that can be enabled by skinlike displays and sensors Still other developments are continuing Advancements in liquid metals allow for stretchable conductive wires Textilebased moistureresistant antennas can transmit data while worn close to the skin Methods like water vapor plasma bonding attach thin metals to soft polymers without losing flexibility or using high temperature and pressure that can damage superthin electronics Sensors are improving too  thats the part that interacts with whatever youre trying to measure Most commercial wearable sensors are mechanical used to track physical activity or optical heartbeat pulse oximetry But chemical sensors are in development to measure internal markers in the body as well These are critical in revealing the full picture of your health says Joseph Wang a doctor of science and professor of nanoengineering at the University of California San Diego who has published research on biosensors and wearable devices For example a rise in lactate and drop in blood pressure can mean you have septic shock Measuring potassium levels can give information about heart rate changes And combining blood pressure and glucose measurements may reveal more about metabolic health than either one alone If you combine them you get better evidence Wang says This is where the new tech can get really geeky Chemical sensors are made from some of the most exotic nano materials including graphene carbon nanotubes and gold nanoparticles Daniele says Some glucose sensors in particular use enzymes that bind to target molecules Others use aptamers short single strands of DNA or RNA Chemical sensors typically work with body fluid such as sweat saliva tears or  as is the case for continuous glucose monitors  interstitial fluid the liquid between the cells in your body Most of the things you want to measure in blood youll be able to do in interstitial fluid if you have the sensor technology says Jason Heikenfeld PhD a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Cincinnati Just imagine having a full blood workup done by simply putting on a skin patch no blood sample requiredHeikenfeld has also investigated sweat which appears useful for measuring hormone levels such as those that regulate stress sex and sleep and prescription drug monitoring  that is monitoring levels of a drug in the body and tracking how quickly its metabolized he says Sweat sensors may also find a place in athome tests Heikenfeld says If there was a peoples choice award for bio fluids sweat would win he says We dont want to do blood dont want to drool in a cup dont want to mess with a urine stick Tears forget it The test would be a simple patch you slap on your arm collect some fluid put it in an envelope and mail it to a lab If you want to create a stretchable flexible electronic device youll need a stretchable flexible and even washable way to power it Many of todays wearables like smartwatches are powered by very small but still rigid batteries Bao says Hence the bulky form Theres certainly a big demand for highenergy density truly flexible batteries she says This demand has prompted researchers from across the globe to develop batteries that can stretch and flex To name just a few recent examples Canadian researchers developed a flexible washable battery that can stretch to double its original length and still function In Singapore scientists created a paperthin biodegradable zinc battery that you can bend and twist and even cut with scissors  like any piece of paper  and it will still work Still others are engineering batteries into long strips that can be used in smart clothing Another option is wireless power Bao says The battery does not need to be in the device  it can be in your clothes or your pocket and still power the sensors Baos lab at Stanford has developed a stickerlike wearable called BodyNet that can be charged using radiofrequency identification the same technology used to control keyless entry to locked rooms Still others  like Misra and her colleagues at ASSIST  are exploring battery alternatives like energy harvesting or converting body heat solar energy or movement into

other symptomsPFAPA syndrome is the most periodic of periodic fevers with many children having an episode every month lasting three to five days said Kalpana Manthiram MD Clinical Fellow at NHGRI and lead author of the study That is an immense burden on families since these kids cannot go to school and may be bedridden for days during flaresWhile PFAPA syndrome has become the most common recurring fever syndrome in children from Western countries diagnosis and treatment methods have remained largely primitive and insufficient The episodes usually spontaneously stop in preadolescenceBecause of the nature of the disease researchers have long thought that answers may lie in genomics After ruling out the possibility that the syndrome is caused by mutations in a single gene they considered the possibility that multiple genes are involvedDuring her clinical fellowship at Vanderbilt University Medical Center from 2012 to 2015 Dr Manthiram discovered that many cases run in families Parents and siblings of patients tend to have frequently inflamed tonsils and canker sores compared to relatives of people without the illnessBut the biggest issue is that there is still no diagnostic test for detecting PFAPA syndrome which means the disease is usually underdiagnosed said Daniel Kastner MD PhD senior author of the paper and NHGRI scientific director Identifying the disease has been mostly based on clinical history and depends on parents and doctors recognizing it We know its time to do better than that and consider that this study will create the scope for more accurate diagnosis of the syndromeTo see which genes if any were involved in the disease Dr Manthiram and her team searched for commonalities in symptoms between PFAPA syndrome and two other inflammatory diseases Behets disease which causes inflammation of blood vessels and canker soresEach illness presented itself with one common symptom  canker soresThe group looked into whether the gene variants known to be associated with those diseases were also present in people with PFAPA syndrome by comparing patients with the disorder from EuropeanAmerican and Turkish ancestries with the general US population They performed more detailed analyses of six genes that are strongly linked to Behets disease and canker soresThe strongest association was with the gene IL12A which encodes an inflammationrelated protein that is used by the immune system The IL12A protein acts as an alarm for the immune system and prompts an inflammatory response by activating various white blood cells Other genes involved in the immune system also showed increased expression in patients such as STAT4 IL10 and CCR1CCR3Due to genomic similarities between PFAPA syndrome Behets and canker sores the researchers proposed naming them Behets spectrum disorders On the severity scale canker sores would be on the mild end Behets disease on the severe end and PFAPA syndrome between the twoThis spectrum is clinically important because a number of patients may have symptoms that are shared between the three diseases which could make it difficult for doctors to isolate their specific condition According to the researchers those patients would be better served if they were referred to having Behets spectrum disordersUltimately the researchers hope that such studies on PFAPA syndrome will yield new treatment options some of which could be drugs that are known to be effective in reducing inflammatory molecules such as IL12Our next goal is to do a larger study and see what other genes might play a role in PFAPA syndrome and to understand what makes the disease special which should make it more easily diagnosable Dr Manthiram said We hope that eventually children dont have to experience such painful disruptions for years and that clinical trials and other followup tests can lead to a successful treatment planNHGRI is one of the 27 institutes and centers at the National Institutes of Health The NHGRI Extramural

cancer program Each has had a long history of NCI support and I celebrate their achievement said Ned Sharpless MD director of NCI Dr Rosenberg is a pioneer whose immunotherapy work has advanced cancer treatment to an immeasurable degree His innovations have changed patients livesThe award has been given annually since 2001 to those who have altered the course of medical research according to the organization A statement from the Albany Medical Center said the prize is being awarded to three visionary scientists whose work has led to a revolutionary new way to treat cancer and other diseasesBecause of the work of these three researchers the nascent field of immunotherapy has already had spectacular success leading to effective mitigation and often cures for thousands of cancer and HIV patients whose diseases were not treatable by other methods said Vincent Verdile MD the Lynne and Mark Groban Distinguished Dean of Albany Medical College and chair of the Albany Prize National Selection Committee Their impact on the development of cancer immunotherapy  and where it goes from here  is unsurpassedWhen Dr Rosenberg started at NCI in the 1970s little was known about T lymphocyte function in cancer He became the first to develop effective immunotherapies and gene therapies for selected patients with advanced cancer and to successfully insert foreign genes into humans His studies of the adoptive cell transfer ACT of genetically modified lymphocytes have resulted in the regression of metastatic cancer in patients with melanoma sarcomas lymphomas and other cancers In October 2017 the Food and Drug Administration approved a form of immunotherapy called CAR Tcell therapy initially developed by Dr Rosenberg and colleagues for certain lymphomasHis current research is aimed at extending ACT to patients with common solid cancers In June findings were published on a new approach Dr Rosenberg developed using a modified form of ACT that led to the complete regression of breast cancer in a patient who was unresponsive to all other treatmentsSteve Rosenberg is a medical trailblazer who envisioned before anyone else a revolutionary new approach to cancer therapy that will soon be taken for granted said Tom Misteli PhD director of CCR at NCI In his work over decades at NCI he has taken full advantage of the ability provided by the NCI Intramural Research program to pursue highrisk longterm research and we are fortunate to have him as a colleagueThe Albany Medical Center Prize was established in 2000 by the late Morris Marty Silverman to honor scientists whose work has demonstrated significant outcomes that offer medical value of national or international importance A 50 million gift commitment from the Marty and Dorothy Silverman Foundation provides for the prize to be awarded annually for 100 years Three previous Nobel Prize winners have been among the researchers honored and five Albany Prize recipients have gone on to win the Nobel PrizeIm honored to receive this award and to be recognized with such luminaries in this field Dr Rosenberg said While in some ways were still just at the start of seeing what immunotherapy can do every day were seeing more progress and we are confident that this treatment will take dramatic steps forward in the years to comeThe prize will be awarded during a celebration on Wednesday

supported by the National Institutes of HealthThe study which involved more than 2400 pregnant adults found that those who received medication to lower their blood pressure below 14090 mm Hg were less likely to have a preterm birth or experience one of several severe pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia a condition marked by sudden high blood pressure and early signs of organ dysfunction The hypertension treatment did not impair fetal growthThe impact of treating chronic hypertension during pregnancy represents a major step forward for supporting people at high risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes said Alan T N Tita MD PhD a principal investigator of the study and the John C Hauth Endowed Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Marnix E Heersink School of MedicineThe findings from the Chronic Hypertension and Pregnancy CHAP trial NCT 02299414 currently the largest trial to study chronic hypertension in pregnancy published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine and were presented on April 2 at the American College of Cardiologys 71st Annual Scientific Session and Expo The study is funded by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute NHLBI part of NIHDiane Reid MD a program officer in the Division of Cardiovascular Sciences at NHLBI said early antihypertensive treatment could be significant for the thousands of US adults who are at risk for preeclampsia or preterm births Chronic hypertension in pregnancy occurs in more than 2 of people and can more than triple the risk for severe complicationsThe CHAP trial enrolled pregnant people with hypertension at 61 US medical centers from 20152021 At the start of the trial hypertension was defined in this study as having systolic blood pressure top number above 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure bottom number above 90 mm Hg Current guidelines define normal blood pressure for nonpregnant adults as less than 12080 mm Hg Participants enrolled in the trial before 23 weeks of pregnancy As part of the study they were followed through delivery and for six weeks after giving birthParticipants were randomized into one of two groups Those in the intervention arm 1208 participants received antihypertensive medication to keep their blood pressure below 14090 mm Hg Those in the control arm 1200 participants did not receive medication to lower their blood pressure unless it rose above 160105 mm Hg a threshold for severe hypertensionResearchers found that of the participants who received antihypertensive treatment 70 experienced no major negative pregnancy outcome while 30 experienced one of the following outcomes preeclampsia with severe features which usually presents after 20 weeks of pregnancy placental abruption preterm birth at less than 35 weeks or fetal or neonatal death In comparison 37 of participants in the control arm experienced a similar negative event In other words the researchers said for every 1415 people treated for hypertension early in pregnancy one was spared from experiencing a severe complication measured in the studyAdditionally the birth weight of the infants did not appear to be affected by antihypertensive treatments The birth weights of infants remained similar between groups  most had normal weights Approximately 112 of babies born to participants who received medication and 104 of babies born to those in the control group had impaired fetal growth which was defined as birth weight being below the 10th percentile for babies of the same gestational ageThe study helps reassure that treating hypertension in pregnancy is safe and effective said ReidShe explains the research will also help inform treatment decisions that have varied because of a shortage of evidence about the benefits of these antihypertensive medications as well as their effects on fetal growth and development Some medical organizations recommend the treatments others discourage them except in cases of severe hypertension The authors note that this study should inform clinical practice guidelinesThe researchers also note the importance of future studies such as those looking at

unable to safely selfquarantine in their place of residence and to isolate those diagnosed with or showing symptoms of COVID19The Ohio camps will be used to house people who test positive for COVID19 who do not require hospitalization but need isolation including those exiting from hospitals those who have been exposed to COVID19 who do not require hospitalization and asymptomatic highrisk individuals needing social distancing as a precautionary measureDan Tierney who works as the press secretary to Ohios Republican Governor Mike DeWine downplayed any worries about the FEMA camps being erected throughout the stateThe order gives the state of Ohio the ability to draw down federal funding to reimburse the local EMA and health department when a noncongregate shelter is needed These shelters are used when an individual is unable to safely quarantine or isolate in their home he said during a press conferenceThe nature of these shelters is no different than what the EMA and others standup during natural disasters The intent of the order is to provide a safe and healthy space for the individual who needs to be quarantined or isolated as determined by local needs This also helps protect family members from exposure FEMA has FAQs and more information available Tierney continuedAs determined by local needs remains ambiguous as an answer to the question of who decides whether a

drunk off power due because of the worldwide COVID19 pandemic is now suggesting morality pills for the public to stop them from resisting their topdown mandates Parker Crutchfield who works as the Associate Professor of Medical Ethics Humanities and Law at Western Michigan University made the suggestion in an oped published in The Conversation When someone chooses not to follow public health guidelines around the coronavirus theyre defecting from the public good Crutchfield writes He is proposing a solution to drug society so that individuals will no longer have the freedom of choice and be at the mercy of the whims of whoever is in power Could a psychoactive pill be the solution to the pandemic Its a farout proposal thats bound to be controversial but one I believe is worth at least considering given the importance of social cooperation in the struggle to get COVID19 under control Crutchfield writes He uses experimental economics to justify his highly invasive solution that is something out of Brave New World Moral enhancement is the use of substances to make you more moral The psychoactive substances act on your ability to reason about what the right thing to do is or your ability to be empathetic or altruistic or cooperative Crutchfield writes He brings up heinous abuses that the government has performed in the past to justify new abuses in the current age The scenario in which the government forces an immunity booster upon everyone is plausible And the military has been forcing enhancements like vaccines or uppers upon soldiers for a long time Crutchfield writesLike after the Sept 11 2001 attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center these emergency actions taken during the crisis could be made permanent The era of the globalist pandemic has arrived

Science Prize The international team competition is an initiative by the National Institutes of Health in collaboration with the Wellcome Trust and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute HHMI The winning team Realtime Evolutionary Tracking for Pathogen Surveillance and Epidemiological Investigation created its nextstrainorg prototype to pool data from researchers across the globe perform rapid phylogenetic analysis and post the results on the platforms website The winning team will receive 230000 to fully develop their prototype with NIH awarding 115000 to the US members of the winning team and the Wellcome Trust and HHMI also contributing 115000 to the winning teamThe Open Science Prize is a global competition designed to foster innovative solutions in public health and biomedicine using open digital content The prize which was launched in October 2015 aims to forge new international collaborations that bring together open science innovators to develop services and tools of benefit to the global research communityNextstrainorg placed first out of three top finalists selected from a pool of 96 multinational interdisciplinary teams including 450 innovators from 45 countries This award is the culmination of a yearlong process which included development and demonstration of working prototypes and multiple stages of rigorous review by panels of expert Open Science advisors and judges from the Wellcome Trust and NIHGenome sequences of viral pathogens provide a hugely valuable insight into the spread of an epidemic but to be useful samples have to be collected analyzed and the results disseminated in near realtime The statistical analyses behind nextstrainorg can be conducted in minutes and can reveal patterns of geographic spread timings of introduction events and can connect cases to aid contact tracing effortsThe phylogenetic analyses are posted on the website as interactive and easy to understand visualizations The team behind nextstrainorg is led by Trevor Bedford PhD of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Seattle and Richard Neher PhD of Biozentrum at the University of Basel Switzerland They hope that the platform will be of great use to researchers public health officials and the public who want a snapshot of an epidemicNextstrainorg aims to synthesize publicly available pathogen genomic data to arrive at an understanding of epidemic spread not available through traditional surveillance systems said BedfordOur efforts with nextstrainorg are only possible through open data sharing by others in the community Weve really enjoyed working with these teams in the field as they collect and share viral genome data added NeherAll stages of the competition emphasized open science in both form and process including public input for the award gathered via a global public voting portal During the public voting phase which narrowed the six finalists to three top contenders nearly 4000 online votes were cast by members of the public from a total of 76 countries on all six inhabited continentsAll six finalist teams were considered exemplary by the funders and are to be commended for their tenacity in developing creative approaches to applying publiclyaccessible data to solve complex biomedical and public health challenges The topics spanned the breadth of biomedical and public challenges ranging from understanding the genetic basis of rare diseases mapping the human brain and enhancing the sharing of clinical trial information As evidenced from the six Open Science Prize finalists public health and biomedical solutions are enriched when data are combined from geographically diverse sources Final prototypes developed by the six finalists can be accessed athttpswwwopenscienceprizeorgAs increasing amounts of data are produced by scientists around the world and made openly available through publiclyaccessible repositories a major challenge to fully maximize this health information will be the lack of tools platforms and services that enable the sharing and synthesizing of disparate data sources Development in this area is essential to turning diverse types of health data into usable and actionable knowledgeMany congratulations to Nextstrainorg Their prototype is an exemplar of open science and will have a great impact on public health by tracking viral pathogens said Robert Kiley who leads Wellcomes work on open research Overall we had received many fantastic submissions for the prize tackling issues from air quality to genomics and clinical trials to neuroscience All entrants demonstrated whats possible when data and code are made open for all We hope that this competition has inspired and spurred on others to think about opening up data to create more innovation in this

Carbohydrates found in fruits vegetables whole grains and beans and other legumes Vitamins such as vitamins A B C D E and K Minerals such as calcium potassium and iron Water both in what you drink and whats naturally in foods Dieting or not everyone needs a mix of those nutrients ideally from foods A good general rule is to use MyPlate which makes it easy to envision just how much of each food type to include in your meal Fill half your plate with fruits and vegetables Split the other half between whole grains and lean protein Stick to your calorie budget because when youre working on losing weight you need to burn more calories than you eat or drink Exactly how many calories you should get per day depends on your goal your age your sex and how active you are A dietitian can help you figure that out Dont cut your calories too much or your diet is going to be hard to stick with and may not give you the nutrients your body needs Choose nonfat or 1 milk instead of 2 or whole milk Select breads and cereals that are made with whole grains and are not prepared with a lot of fat You dont have to completely avoid all foods that have fat cholesterol or sodium Its your average over a few days not in a single food or even a single meal thats important If you eat a highcalorie food or meal balance your intake by choosing lowcalorie foods the rest of the day or the next day Check the food labels on packaged foods to help you budget fat cholesterol and sodium over several days Thats just the start of what you might want to know about nutrition for weight loss Keep learning as much as you can including the following termsCalories are a measurement like an inch or a tablespoon They note how much energy is released when your body breaks down food The more calories a food has the more energy it can provide to the body When you eat more calories than you need your body stores the extra calories as fat Even lowcarb and fatfree foods can have a lot of calories that can be stored as fat Proteins help repair and maintain your body including muscle You can get protein in all types of food Good sources include fish meat poultry eggs cheese nuts beans and other legumes Your body needs some fat But most Americans get too much of it which makes high cholesterol and heart disease more likely There are several types of fats Saturated fats found in cheese meat wholefat dairy products butter and palm and coconut oils You should limit these Depending on whether you have high cholesterol heart disease diabetes or other conditions a dietitian or your doctor can let you know your limit Polyunsaturated fats These include omega3 fatty acids found in soybean oil canola oil walnuts flaxseed and fish including trout herring and salmon and omega6 fatty acids soybean oil corn oil safflower oil Monounsaturated fats These come from plant sources Theyre found in nuts vegetable oil canola oil olive oil sunflower oil safflower oil and avocado Cholesterol Another type of fat found in foods that come from animals Trans fat Some trans fat is naturally found in fatty meat and dairy products Artificial trans fats have been widely used in packaged baked goods and microwave popcorn Theyre bad for heart health so avoid them as much as possible Although trans fats are less common in recent years you can still look at the nutrition facts label to see how much trans fat is in an item Know that something that says 0 g trans fat may actually have up to half a gram of trans fat in it So also check the ingredients list If it mentions partially hydrogenated oils those are trans fatsCarbohydrates give your body fuel in the form of glucose which is a type of sugar Adults should get about 35 to 55 of their calories from carbohydrates Most Americans eat too many carbohydrates especially processed carbs leading to obesity prediabetes and diabetes Some carbs are rich in nutrients Those include whole grains fruits vegetables and legumes Other carbs are sugary and starchy and not high in nutrients You should limit those which include candy pastries cookies chips soft drinks and fruit drinks Vitamins help with chemical reactions in the body In general vitamins must come from the diet the body doesnt make them There are 13 essential vitamins Your body can store vitamins A D E and K and it can be a problem if you get too much of them Vitamin C and

1811,2048,"""Brenda Goodman is a senior news writer for WebMD Andy Miller is editor and CEO of Georgia Health News Sept 25 2019  In 2005 the US Environmental Protection Agency considered banning ethylene oxide in new sterilizing facilities because of the cancer risk it posed to residents who lived around the plants We also considered prohibiting the use of ethylene oxide for new facilities which would necessitate the use of an alternative sterilization process reads the proposed rule published in the federal register on Oct 24 2005 Ultimately under pressure from industry and with the EPAs acceptance of companies claims they were doing everything feasible to cut their emissions the agency failed to act  worried about disrupting a key part of the process of sterilizing medical equipment in the US Fastforward to 2019 and whats past looks a lot like prologue Once again the EPA is considering new restrictions on ethylene oxide sterilization because of the cancer risks it poses Once again the sterilizing and medical device industries are pushing back warning of harm to patients if ethylene oxide is restricted Federal lobbying disclosures show medical device makers and sterilizers have spent more than 1 million over the past 12 months lobbying Congress and the EPA on ethylene oxide issues Theres a big difference this time around though public awareness Nobody in the last 40 years has been pressuring from the outside that there are community exposures from this said Peter Orris MD a professor and chief of occupational and environmental medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago Greater appreciation of the environmental health threat has  for the first time  raised an outcry from residents in Georgia Illinois and elsewhere whove been exposed to ethylene oxide pollution  sometimes for decades  without any real warning that it was near them or could be dangerous In 2018 the EPA published a report that flagged 109 census tracts across the US as having higher cancer risks mostly due to ethylene oxide Three of those census tracts are in the metro Atlanta area  two are in Fulton County just south of Smyrna and the third is in Newton County in CovingtonOrris first encountered ethylene oxide when he was a regional medical officer for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health In the 1980s he investigated cases of hospital staff getting lightheaded and dizzy and having other neurologic symptoms working around tabletop sterilizing devices that used ethylene oxide gas The sterilizing devices  which look a bit like big microwaves  were leaking making people who worked near them ill In learning about the gas he recalls I finally concluded that you just couldnt do this because every amount of exposure contributes to cancer risk The outrage from exposed communities has federal regulators and device makers seriously rethinking a question thats been hanging over the sterilization industry for decades Can ethylene oxide be replaced A resolution pending before the American Medical Associations Board of Trustees urges the nations doctors to push for substitutes to ethylene oxide sterilization that are currently available and do not cause cancer It also urges hospitals and other health care facilities when considering buying medical devices to choose those that are the most effective for patients and safest for the environment The FDA also recently issued a pair of innovation challenges to researchers and industry in an effort to reduce dependence on the toxic gas The challenges come several months after Illinois Democrats  including US Sens Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin  urged the agency to find alternatives to ethylene oxide or EtO after a public outcry over the cancercausing gas erupted in Willowbrook IL the site of a Sterigenics medical sterilization facility It is critical that FDA begin investigating alternatives to the EtO sterilization process and prioritize swift adoption of safer methods and substances Americans should not be forced to choose between sterile medical equipment and increased cancer risks the letter states When cardiologists need to repair the heart they often use a cardiac catheter  a long flexible tube threaded up to the heart through an incision in the leg These catheters use a guide wire that has to slip easily along the walls of the plastic tubing The guide wires are sometimes coated with Teflon to reduce frictionTeflon cant withstand gamma radiation the second most common kind of sterilization for medical products When Teflon is treated with gamma radiation the radiation turns it to powder Other kinds of materials can bond more tightly after exposure to radiation which can make them brittle In public statements Phil Macnabb president of Sterigenics likes to point to vascular catheters as an example of a medical device that cant be sterilized with anything but ethylene oxide But thats an overgeneralization says Jeff Sauter director of business development for a company called SteriTek which is based in Fremont CA SteriTek sterilizes products with electron beam and Xray radiation which represent smaller segments of the market Sauter says not all catheters use radiationsensitive materials We sterilize catheters every day We sterilize millions of catheters including heart catheters that use guide wires he says Sterilization is a concern for hospitals and other health care facilities Healthcareassociated nfections cause thousands of deaths every year and hospitals can be penalized financially and publicly if their patients catch preventable infections while in their care From a strictly technical standpoint most materials used in medical devices dont have to be sterilized with ethylene oxide says Karl Hemmerich a medical device consultant based in Salt Lake City In 2017 Hemmerich was chairman of a 40member working group for the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation that created a guide to help medical device engineers understand which sterilization methods could be used with different kinds of materials Their guide shows there are alternatives to ethylene oxide for most materials In some limited number of cases its going to be difficult to switch Hemmerich says He estimates that only 20 of medical supplies need to be sterilized with ethylene oxide For example the only method now used to sterilize electronic medical devices is ethylene oxide The bigger hurdle Sauter says is that companies have to certify to the FDA that the method they choose will kill germs well enough Once companies have their product validated with ethylene oxide its very very expensive to switch he saysSauter says proving that a different method will meet the FDAs sterility standard requires rounds of studies It can take a couple of years and it could cost a million dollars he says Greg Crist chief advocacy officer for the Advanced Medical Technology Association or AdvaMed says device manufacturers have been exploring other sterilization methods but so far none have been a perfect fit It would take 7 to 10 years to bring an alternative Were studying packaging alternatives Using less cardboard less plastic would use less ethylene oxide Crist says He says there is a very active search for alternatives No one is arguing that ethylene oxide is not toxic Crist says Ethylene oxide is not the first best choice to sterilize medical devices Still Crist says his pitch to lawmakers is simple As you consider regulating this please bear in mind the public health impact of potential device shortages Currently ethylene oxide gas is used to sterilize 50 of all medical supplies that require that high level of disinfection  everything from plastic surgical gowns to syringes catheters bandages gauze and pacemakers It doesnt require high heat to kill germs so it works on supplies that are sensitive to high temperatures It is also readily absorbed through most types of packaging and seeps deeply through layers of materials  it even passes through plastic  which means device makers can sterilize whole pallets of hospital supplies at the same time without ever having to unwrap them Gamma radiation handles about 40 of sterilized supplies Like ethylene oxide products dont have to be removed from their final packaging which helps to cut down on handling and the chance that something could be contaminated again Other kinds of radiation  like electron beams and Xrays  can also kill germs but theyre not as commonly used Not all materials can withstand radiation Besides finding sterilization methods and materials that work well together another potential problem is that sterilization facilities would be expensive for companies to overhaul The EPA acknowledged that in its 2005 proposed ruleEthylene oxide and radiation technologies both gamma and ebeam share no common equipment Any conversion would involve scrapping the ethylene oxide chambers and related specialized equipment and systems and likely displacing the existing workforce the proposed rule reads Still a manufacturer can switch the sterilization method they want to use for a given device as long as they clear it with the FDA In a 2005 email exchange between the FDA and EPA about device sterilization FDA chemist Elaine Mayhall explained that all medical device manufacturers are required to choose a sterilization method that will meet the FDAs specifications A number of different methods can get to that same point she said The limitations are the cost how devices are packaged and whether a sterilizer can penetrate the device packaging so that the device doesnt need to be handled after all the germs are killed Besides ethylene oxide there are other gases that can sterilize products at lower temperatures Besides ethylene oxide there are other kinds of gases such as hydrogen peroxide and nitrogen dioxide that can be used to sterilize medical devices Steam the original method for killing germs still handles much of the sterilization in doctors offices and hospitals Hydrogen peroxide gas is mostly used in small machines in hospitals to sterilize reusable medical devices It breaks down into hydrogen and water at the end of its cycle leaving no toxic residues Like ethylene oxide the process works for equipment thats sensitive to moisture and heat One disadvantage of this method though is that it doesnt penetrate materials the same way ethylene oxide does The nitrogen dioxide sterilization method is sold by a company called Noxilizer which is headquartered in Hanover MD Like ethylene oxide it can sterilize devices at lower temperatures which is good for things that are sensitive to heat but it doesnt penetrate material the same way ethylene oxide does It works on surfaces There are strengths and weaknesses to every sterilization process says Maura Kahn vice president of business development for NoxilizerNitrogen dioxide gas isnt completely harmless As a component of air pollution it can cause lung problems and its associated with lung cancer Noxilizer says its equipment lowers the amount thats released from the small chambers it uses to 1 part per million far lower than the law requires Hemmerich says that most things that kill harmful germs arent very good for people either Gamma radiation can be deadly if workers are accidentally exposed he points out Despite its downsides Hemmerich doesnt want to see ethylene oxide taken off the market He says it is an effective product that has to be handled carefully You have to have systems in place to keep the end user the factory workers the management all safe One facility wasnt very good at it and now were all running around trying to find alternates Its going to be a tough road he says Both device makers and the FDA have warned there could be shortages if ethylene oxide is taken offline too quickly In February after state regulators abruptly closed a Sterigenics facility in Willowbrook IL for elevated levels of ethylene oxide in outdoor air the FDA published a list of 594 different types of medical devices that could have been in short supply because of the closure Sterigenics is one of the largest commercial sterilizing companies It operates 19 facilities around the world that use ethylene oxide for sterilization another 28 use gamma radiation for the same purpose Ultimately the shutdown only affected one device  a tracheostomy tube  and it was available again about 10 days later after the FDA cut its own red tape Regulators expedited a process the FDA requires manufacturers to follow to change what facility they use to sterilize a device Normally that would go through a 180day 6month review said Suzanne Schwartz MD associate director for science and strategic partnerships at the FDAs Center for Devices and Radiological Health Schwartz says the agency has agreed to cut the time to review changes to sterilization sites to just 30 daysThere are other regulatory hurdles to overcome When device makers seek approval from the FDA to sell their products they have to specify not just how they will be sterilized but where The FDA keeps records on where devices are sterilized in case it needs to investigate an infection outbreak Manufacturers have to get permission from the FDA to switch a sterilization site or method With regulation for ethylene oxide on the horizon some device manufacturers have been telling legislators that their hands are tied when it comes to sterilization Medtronic for example when asked about its use of ethylene oxide sent this statement The FDA currently requires ethylene oxide sterilization for certain medical devices due to the sensitive nature of their materials or complexity of design the statement reads While Medtronic continues to explore and advocate for safe sterilization alternatives that preserve the performance and integrity of our devices we will continue our responsible use of EtO to sterilize certain medical equipment used in surgeries and other medical procedures in compliance with FDA requirements it reads Thats an argument thats been made for decades by device makers but it isnt quite accurate the FDA says The FDA does not require a specific modality of sterilization for medical devices an agency spokesperson said in response to Medtronics statement The agency does acknowledge that ethylene oxide may be the only way to sterilize a sensitive device without damaging it but the manufacturer determines that not the FDA Hemmerich says ethylene oxide has become a default choice A lot of that comes predetermined at a lot of companies he says and medical device engineers turn to ethylene oxide because Thats what we always do For its innovation challenges the FDA is asking participants to come up with sterilization alternatives to ethylene oxide that are compatible with a wide variety of materials and can sterilize supplies in bulk The second challenge asks for new ways to reduce ethylene oxide emissions from facilities that use the gas Applications for the challenges are being accepted through midOctober Chosen submissions will be announced in December""",WebMD,real,0,1811

1083,1554,"""In adolescents oral Truvada and vaginal ring for HIV prevention are safe acceptableNIHfunded clinical trials are first of their kind to include younger adolescent girlsA monthly vaginal ring and a daily oral tablet both containing antiHIV drugs were safe and acceptable in studies of adolescents two teams of investigators reported today at the 9th IAS Conference on HIV Science in Paris The experimental ring is designed for HIV prevention and the oral tablet is already used for this purpose in adults Adherence to the ring was high while adherence to the tablet was moderate and diminished substantially when study visits became less frequent These studies mark the first time the vaginal ring was tested in adolescent girls younger than 18 years and the first time a clinical trial of the oral tablet as preexposure prophylaxis PrEP specifically for adolescents included girls The findings pave the way for larger trials of the vaginal ring and oral PrEP in this vulnerable age groupAdolescents and young people represent a growing share of people living with HIV worldwide noted Anthony S Fauci MD director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID part of the National Institutes of Health NIH Science has demonstrated that the HIV prevention needs of adolescents may be different than those of adults which is why these new study findings are so importantBoth trials were funded in part or in whole by NIAIDThe study of oral PrEP  called Choices for Adolescent Prevention Methods for South Africa or CHAMPS PlusPills  is only the second clinical trial to report results of PrEP focused solely on adolescents The NIAIDfunded Phase 2 study evaluated the safety acceptability and use of daily oral Truvada which contains two antiHIV drugs as part of an HIV preventionpackage for this age group Truvada is not yet approved by any national regulatory body for use as oral PrEP in adolescentsCHAMPS PlusPills involved 148 healthy sexually active HIVuninfected South African 15 to 19yearolds in Cape Town and Johannesburg The group included 99 girls and 49 boys Participants were asked to take daily oral Truvada for at least three months and up to one year if they chose to do soThe researchers found that most participants chose to take daily oral Truvada which was safe and tolerable for the adolescents Although the number of participants who actually took Truvada as prescribed was lower than the number who opted in and decreased over time nearly 40 percent were adherent by the end of the study Only one participant became infected with HIV during the trial a 19yearold who had stopped taking Truvada three months before her HIV diagnosisDuring the first three months of the trial participants had monthly study visits and subsequent visits occurred quarterly Participants could choose to opt out of continue or resume taking Truvada for PrEP at every quarterly visit All participants were followed for the entire study year At each visit researchers monitored participants health and collected blood samples to test for evidence of adherence to Truvada which contains the drugs tenofovir and emtricitabineAt three months tenofovir was detectable in the blood samples of 57 percent of participants and 82 percent of participants opted to continue taking Truvada for PrEP At six months tenofovir was detectable in the blood samples of 38 percent of participants and 64 percent opted to continue or resume taking Truvada Sixtyfour percent of participants also opted to continue or resume taking Truvada at nine months At the end of the year 38 percent of participants tested positive for tenofovir Participants frequently cited lowgrade side effects such as nausea or headache as the reason they stopped taking Truvada as oral PrEPThe HIV prevention package given to all CHAMPS PlusPills study participants included HIV testing management of sexually transmitted infections counseling on how to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV access to condoms postexposure prophylaxis shortterm antiHIV treatment to reduce the likelihood of HIV infection after potential exposure and counseling on the ongoing need for Truvada as oral PrEP Boys also received counseling and referral for male circumcision which has been proven to reduce the risk of HIV infection in menIn addition investigators offered three optional HIV prevention components designed specifically for adolescents Participants could elect to receive daily or weekly text messages reminding them to take their Truvada and querying if they encountered a problem Participants also could join socalled adherence clubs where groups of participants met regularly with a community health worker for group counseling and support for taking Truvada for PrEP Finally participants could receive realtime reports of the level of tenofovir in their blood during study visitsThe trend toward lower adherence to Truvada for PrEP as study visits became less frequent parallels what was observed in a study of PrEP in adolescent gay and bisexual boys suggesting that monthly study visits may support greater adherence to oral PrEP among adolescents over time said Protocol Chair and International AIDS Society President LindaGail Bekker MBChB PhD Dr Bekker is deputy director of the Desmond Tutu HIV Centre at the University of Cape Town South AfricaThe study results contribute to a growing body of data that could support the development of evidencebased guidelines for the use of Truvada as oral PrEP in adolescentsMore information about CHAMPS PlusPills is available on

infections among adults globally in 2015 despite composing only 11 percent of the adult populationAn earlier NIAIDfunded study called ASPIRE which enrolled women 18 to 45 years old tested a ring that continuously releases the experimental antiHIV drug dapivirine in the vagina over one month The results reported in 2016 showed 27 percent protection overall but no protection in women ages 18 to 21 likely due to low adherence A subsequent exploratory analysis of ASPIRE study data found that using the ring most or all of the time reduced the risk of HIV infection in women by at least 56 percentBecause some younger adolescent girls also need HIV prevention options a Phase 2a clinical trial called MTN023IPM 030 was conducted in the United States to examine the safety and acceptability of the dapivirine ring among sexually active girls from 15 to 17 years old The results of this study were reported at the Paris conference todayNinetysix girls enrolled at six US sites were assigned at random to receive either the dapivirine ring or a placebo ring in a 3to1 ratio Neither the participants nor the investigators knew who had received which ring until the end of the trial Participants were asked to insert a new ring each month for 6 months Researchers monitored participants health and gauged adherence by measuring the amount of dapivirine in blood samples and used ringsInvestigators found that the dapivirine ring was safe and acceptable to study participants Adherence to the ring was high drug levels in 87 percent of blood samples and 95 percent of used rings met prespecified adherence criteria Overall participants said they liked the ring at 93 percent of study visits Their main concerns were keeping the ring clean and that their primary sexual partner would feel the ring during sexWe are encouraged by these results of the dapivirine ring in 15 to 17yearold girls said Sharon Hillier PhD principal investigator of the NIHfunded Microbicide Trials

in social situations is a heritable behavior that is altered in children with autism according to a study funded by the National Institutes of Health The study appears in the latest issue of Nature Autism spectrum disorder affects how a person acts communicates and learns In the United States approximately 1 out of 68 children has the disorderReduced attention to other peoples eyes and faces is a behavior associated with autism and it is often used to screen for and help diagnose the disorder In the current study NIHfunded researchers from Washington University in St Louis and Emory University in Atlanta explored the potential genetic foundation of this behavior which can appear by the first 6 months of age and persist as children grow olderResearch shows that autism likely has a genetic basis Siblings of children diagnosed with autism and people with certain genetic mutations have a higher risk of developing the disorder compared to the general population said Diana Bianchi MD director of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development NICHD which provided funding for the study along with the National Institute of Mental Health NIMH Understanding how genes influence social behaviors will help researchers identify new or better ways to treat autismThe study team conducted eyetracking experiments in a group of 250 typically developing toddlers ages 18 to 24 months including 82 identical twins 41 pairs 84 nonidentical twins 42 pairs and 84 nonsibling children 42 randomized pairs They also evaluated 88 nontwin children diagnosed with autismEach child watched videos that showed either an actress speaking directly to the viewer or scenes of children interacting in daycare In all video frames children could look at the

found that identical twins had synchronized visual patterns compared to nonidentical twins and nonsibling pairs Identical twins tended to shift their eyes at the same times and in the same direction They also were more likely to look at the subjects eyes or mouth at the same momentsUsing a statistical measurement called the intraclass correlation coefficient ICC which measures how well individuals within a group resemble each other with a value of 1 marking perfect agreement the researchers found that identical twins had an ICC of 091 for eyelooking and 086 for mouthlooking On the other hand nonidentical twins had scores of 035 and 044 respectively while nonsibling pairs had scores of 016 and 013By comparing identical twins who share the same genes to nonidentical twins and randomly paired children who do not share the same genes the study is one of the first to show that social visual behaviors are under genetic control said Lisa Gilotty PhD chief of NIMHs Research Program on Autism Spectrum DisordersTo explore this concept further the researchers evaluated children with autism and discovered that they looked at eye and mouth regions  the most heritable visual traits  much less compared to the other groups of childrenWith these findings researchers can explore which genes are involved in social visual engagement how these genes interact with a childs

Moderna Inc a biotechnology company based in Cambridge Massachusetts for its COVID19 vaccine which was codeveloped with scientists at the National Institutes of Healths National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID This innovative and monumental partnership has enabled NIH and Moderna to develop a safe and effective COVID19 vaccine within the span of a year that will be manufactured and distributed across the US The vaccine called mRNA1273 is a messenger RNA mRNA vaccine against COVID19 encoding a prefusion stabilized form of the spike protein of SARSCoV2 codeveloped by investigators from Moderna and NIAIDs Vaccine Research Center The approach to stabilize the coronavirus spike protein called S2P was developed by NIAID scientists and their collaborators at Scripps Research Dartmouth College and the University of Texas at Austin NIAID supported the early development of the mRNA1273 vaccine and worked with Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority BARDA scientists to support the mid and latestages of clinical development with BARDA leading government support of the scaleup of manufacturing and regulatory pathway to EUA The mRNA1273 vaccine is the second COVID19 vaccine in the United States to be granted an EUA NIH Director Francis S Collins MD PhD NIAID Director Anthony S Fauci MD and BARDA Director Gary Disbrow PhD released the following statementsIt has been less than a year since the world first learned of SARSCoV2 and the terrible disease it can cause To have not one but two safe and highly effective COVID19 vaccines ready for deployment to the American public is truly a remarkable scientific achievement and a significant step toward ending the pandemic that has caused so much suffering The partnership to develop the mRNA1273 vaccine is a prime example of the tremendous good that can be accomplished when the public and private sectors work together to address a serious public health problem It is through the dedicated efforts of our federal scientists and their collaborators at Moderna and in academia the clinical staff who conducted the vaccines rigorous clinical trials and the tens of thousands of study participants who selflessly rolled up their sleeves that another safe and highly effective vaccine to protect against COVID19 will soon be rolled out to the American public  NIH Director Francis S Collins MD PhDSeveral years before SARSCoV2 entered the public consciousness NIAID scientists were working with Moderna to develop vaccines for other coronaviruses That existing scientific foundation is what enabled both partners to move quickly to develop the mRNA1273 vaccine candidate against the novel SARSCoV2 coronavirus NIAID conducted the initial Phase 1 testing of the vaccine and with the support of BARDA and other Operation Warp Speed partners played a central role in its largescale clinical trial Throughout each stage of clinical testing the Moderna vaccine proved to be safe and highly effective at preventing symptomatic COVID19 In a study of more than 30000 people it demonstrated 94 efficacy and subsequent analyses have revealed that the vaccine induces a durable immune response There is much we still do not know about SARSCoV2 and COVID19 However we do know that this vaccine is safe and can prevent symptomatic COVID19 and severe disease It is my hope that all Americans will protect themselves by getting vaccinated when the vaccine becomes available to them That is how our country will begin to heal and move forward   NIAID Director Anthony S Fauci MDToday stands as a reminder of what can be accomplished when people come together to reach a common goal We are working with a constant sense of urgency to bring vaccines therapeutics and diagnostics to bear to end the crisis As partners in Operation Warp Speed NIAID and BARDA scientists collaborated with Moderna adding BARDAs expertise in latestage clinical trials scaleup manufacturing and regulatory requirements By collaborating we were able to complete these steps in parallel and accelerate the development of a safe and effective vaccine While we celebrate todays accomplishment we recognize that there is still much work to do to ensure every American who wants a COVID19 vaccine receives one Every American has been touched in some way by this virus and so we will continue to push forward With

friends to use the devices in school bathrooms without fear of being caught He would use an entire cartridge containing the vape liquid the equivalent to smoking one pack of tobacco cigarettes within one school day By fall semester of his first year in college Jake said he had increased his use even more It got pricey so thats when I really started to notice the extent of his dependency he said recently Vaping rates among teenagers in Maine doubled from 153 to 287 between 2017 and 2019 while Jake was in high school In 2021 11 of high schoolers across the nation said they regularly smoked ecigarettes and an estimated 28 have at least tried the devices according to the CDC The FDA classifies ecigarettes as a tobacco product because many contain nicotine which comes from tobacco Like Jake the habit is likely to carry into adulthood for many who start in their teenage years experts say Electronic nicotine delivery systems ENDS such as vapes have been touted by their makers and some in the medical field as a healthier alternative to cigarettes and as a way to help smokers give up the habit But thats not how Jake  who had never used traditional cigarettes  picked up vaping or how he sold the idea to his mother Its all organic and natural flavoring its just flavored water Mary Lou Warn recalled her son saying to her She researched the health effects of vaping but didnt find much online But I knew they were dangerous because you dont put anything in your lungs that isnt fresh air A determined athlete in high school Jake found his asthma worsened as he transitioned to college especially when he ran a track meet or played in a soccer gameVapes basically have created a pediatric tobaccouse epidemic Schneider said What were seeing is unprecedented tobacco use rates higher rates than weve seen in decades One reason many young people start vaping is the attraction to flavors ranging from classic menthol to fruits and sweets A handful of states have banned or restricted the sale of flavored vapes Its new and its just been marketed in a way that were really fighting the false narrative put out there by makers of these products that are trying to make them appealing to kids said Rachel Boykan MD a clinical professor of pediatrics and attending doctor at Stony Brook Childrens Hospital in Stony Brook NY The flavor Red Bull in particular hooked Jake And though he wasnt aware of it at the time nicotine packed into the pods may have kept him from quitting The average nicotine concentration in ecigarettes more than doubled from 2013 to 2018 according to a study by the Truth Initiative and the CDC The immediate risks of nicotine on the developing brain are welldocumented Studies suggest that nicotine  which is found in vape products  may impact adolescents ability to learn remember and maintain attention But many adolescents and young adults who use ecigarettes say that vaping helps ease anxiety and keep them attentive which also adds to the complexity of their dependency according to Boykan Nicotine actually interrupts neural circuits that it can be associated with more anxiety depression attention to learning and susceptibility to other addictive substances she said That is enough to make it very scary Jake also said a social environment where so many of his friends vaped also made it difficult for him to quit Youre hanging out with your friends at night and all of them are using it and youre trying to not to he said Jake eventually took a semester off from college for an unrelated surgery and he moved home and away from his vaping classmates He eventually transferred to a different college and lived at home where no one vaped and where he wasnt allowed to smoke in the house he saidHe came home and we took him to a doctor and they didnt know quite how to handle kids and addiction to ecigarettes Mary Lou Warn said Not fully understanding the longterm health implications of ecigarette use has stopped many health care providers from offering clear messaging on the risk of vaping to current and potential users Its taken pediatricians time to ask the right questions and recognize nicotine addiction from vaping said Boykan whos also chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics section on nicotine and tobacco prevention and treatment Its just hit us so fast But once pediatricians do identify a nicotine dependency it can be difficult to treat Boykan said Many pediatricians now recognize that ecigarette addiction may occur in children as early as middle school We dont have a lot of evidencebased treatments for kids to recommend she said Aware of his vaping dependency and the possible risks to his longterm health Jake now 23 said hes lessened his use compared to his college days but still struggles to kick the habit for good Id like to not be able to use all the time not to feel the urge he said But I think over time itll just kind of phase out But his mother said quitting may not be that simple This will be a lifelong journey she said When I think of who he is addiction is something he will always have Its a part of him now""",WebMD,real,0,1153

monitoring and treatmentNew research shows that a treatment for retinal vein occlusion yields longlasting vision gains with visual acuity remaining significantly above baseline at five years However many patients require ongoing treatment Retinal vein occlusion is one of the most common blinding conditions in the United States without treatment central retinal vein occlusion CRVO the most severe type of retinal vein occlusion often leads to significant and permanent vision loss A report on fiveyear outcomes of the Study of Comparative Treatments for Retinal Vein Occlusion 2 SCORE2 was published April 21 in American Journal of Ophthalmology SCORE2 was funded in part by the National Eye Institute NEI a part of the National Institutes of HealthRetinal vein occlusion is caused by a blockage of the veins carrying blood away from the retina the lightsensitive tissue at the back of the eye This blockage can lead to macular edema where fluid becomes trapped within and under the retina leading to rapid and severe loss of visual acuity Without treatment this condition typically leads to permanent loss of vision The most effective treatment injections of antivascular endothelial growth factor VEGF drugs helps control blood vessel leakage and swelling in the retinaWhile antiVEGF therapy is associated with significant improvement in both retinal swelling and visual acuity in patients with central or hemiretinal vein occlusion our findings show that most of the patients followed still required treatment to control the macular edema for at least five years said Ingrid U Scott MD MPH Penn State College of Medicine Hershey chair of the study This demonstrates the importance of continued monitoring of these patientsIn 2017 SCORE2 clinical trial investigators reported that two types of antiVEGF treatment were equally effective at improving visual acuity in people with macular edema due to CRVO or hemiretinal vein occlusion HRVO CRVO affects the entire retina while HRVO generally affects about half of the retina Half of the study participants had been given Avastin bevacizumab while the other half received Eylea aflibercept Both drugs were administered by injection once per month for six months At the sixmonth mark the vision of participants in both groups had on average improved over three lines on an eye chartAs detailed in this new report the study investigators followed SCORE2 participants for five years collecting information about their visual acuity treatments and whether their macular edema had resolved After the initial 12month study period participants were treated at their physicians discretion Most physicians reduced the frequency of antiVEGF injections and some switched their patients to the other antiVEGF drug At five years many participants had lost some visual acuity when compared to their acuity at the 12month mark however they retained on average three lines of improvement compared to their acuity at the beginning of the studyIt was surprising to us that despite many participants still needing treatment after five years their visual acuity outcome remained very good said Michael Ip MD cochair of the study from Doheny Eye Institute University of California Los Angeles In comparison to this treatment for wet agerelated macular degeneration where initial vision improvements fade over time these results are quite favorableThis fiveyear study tells us a lot about whats happening with retinal vein occlusion patients in the real world said Scott Prior to this study retinal vein occlusion was widely considered an acute illness This study shows that RVO is a chronic disease It also underscores the importance of disease monitoring and individualized treatment to achieve the best possible visionThe SCORE2 study provides invaluable data to guide clinicians and their patients toward informed decisions regarding treatment for retinal vein occlusion said NEI Director Michael F Chiang MDThe

3282,657,"""Opposite Opinion on Sex Differences in the Human BrainA scientific analysis of more than 2000 brain scans has sparked controversy over claims of reproducible sex differences in the volume of certain regions in the human brain The study led by researchers at the National Institute of Mental Health NIMH suggests that these differences may be influenced by sex chromosomes However critics argue that the studys findings are inconclusive and fail to provide a definitive explanation for the observed differencesWhile some studies have suggested that sexbased differences in brain anatomy are due to the effects of sex hormones recent research in mice has revealed consistent sex differences in cortical structures as well The NIMH study aimed to explore the neurobiological basis of sex differences in the human brain by analyzing neuroimaging data However the researchers methodology and findings have been met with skepticism by some expertsCritics argue that the studys sample size of 976 healthy adults between the ages of 22 and 35 may not be representative of the broader population They also question the reproducibility of the findings contending that the statistical analyses employed by the researchers may not adequately account for confounding factors Additionally concerns have been raised about the generalizability of the studys results as the dataset used was obtained from the Human Connectome Project and had notable demographic and methodological differences from the UK Biobank dataset used for crossvalidationFurthermore critics argue that the linkage between the observed sex differences in brain volume and gene expression in postmortem samples is tenuous at best The use of publicly available maps of geneexpression in the brain which are based on a limited number of postmortem tissue samples may not accurately reflect the overall gene expression patterns in the population Without a comprehensive understanding of the underlying genetic mechanisms it is premature to conclude that sexbased differences in brain anatomy are primarily due to genetic factorsThe researchers also compared their anatomical findings with functional neuroimaging studies but critics assert that the spatial overlap observed does not necessarily imply a causal relationship The brain is a complex organ and making deterministic claims based on correlational findings is unwarrantedTherefore it is important to exercise caution when interpreting the findings of this study While the researchers have attempted to shed light on sex differences in brain anatomy it is clear that further research is needed before drawing definitive conclusions The interaction between genetics hormones and other environmental factors is complex and requires a more comprehensive approach to fully understand the mechanisms underlying sex differences in the human brain""",Nih,ab_all,1,3282

unjabbed counterpartsThis study was enormous in scale sifting through data collected from over 100000 people infected by the Omicron variantBYPASS THE CENSORS Sign up to get unfiltered news delivered straight to your inbox Email Email This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged Noqreportcom reports Here are the key pointsThose who have been fully vaccinated with two shots from Moderna or Pfizer are more likely to contract Covid19 than those who have not been vaccinated at allBooster shots offer protection approximately equal to natural immunity but the benefits wane after 25 monthsNatural immunity lasts for at least 300days which is the length of the study it likely lasts much longerThis jibes with the current narrative coming from Big Pharma and their minions in government and corporate media that the jabs are supposed to mitigate the effects But even that claim has been called into question as recent studies indicate the vaccinated may be dying even more than the unvaccinated According to The ExposThe Government of Canada has confirmed that the vaccinated population account for 4 in every 5 Covid19 deaths to have occurred across the country since the middle of February 2022 and 70 of those deaths have been among the triple vaccinated populationDespite the scope of the study and the credibility of the source it will not receive any attention from corporate media It is imperative that our readers get the word out because this is an absolute narrativebuster for Big Pharma Now more than ever we must alert the people of the truth because we are on the verge of seeing millions of children under the age of fiveyearsold injectedThe good news is weve seen more vaccinated people becoming receptive to the truth Thats anecdotal based on what Im seeing online and the correspondence I receive but I believe there are more people who are becoming skeptical of governments unhinged push for universal vaccinations If we can share more news that will keep them from getting boosted and more importantly keep them from jabbing their children then its a worthwhile effortIf this is as I believe part of a nefarious plan to control people and enact the globalist elites depopulation agenda then it behooves us to prevent as many people as possible from getting boosted The science seems to indicate more shots mean more damage so limiting exposure is important Were going to need allies if things continue down this road The fewer boosteraddicted Americans the betterHere are the details regarding the news study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in an article by Marina Zhang from our premium news partners at The Epoch TimesVaccination Increases Risk of COVID19 But Infection Without Vaccination Gives Immunity StudyHaving two doses of a COVID19 vaccine has been linked with negative protection against the disease scientists say while a previous infection without vaccination offers around 50 percent immunity according to a study analyzing the Omicron wave in QatarThe study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on June 15 examined the Omicron wave in Qatar that occurred from around December 2021 to February 2022 comparing vaccination rates and immunity among more than 100000 Omicron infected and noninfected individualsThe authors of the study found that those who had a prior infection but no vaccination had a 461 and 50 percent immunity against the two subvariants of the Omicron variant even at an interval of more than 300 days since the previous infectionHowever individuals who received two doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine but had no previous infection were found with negative immunity against both BA1 and BA2 Omicron subvariants indicating an increased risk of contracting COVID19 than an average personOver six months after getting two doses of the Pfizer vaccine immunity against any Omicron infection dropped to 34 percent But for two doses of the Moderna vaccine immunity against any Omicron infection dropped to 103 percent after more than six months since the last injectionThough the authors reported that three doses of the Pfizer vaccine increased immunity to over 50 percent this was measured just over 40 days after the third vaccination which is a very short interval In comparison natural immunity persisted at around 50 percent when measured over 300 days after the previous infection while immunity levels fell to negative figures 270 days after the second dose of vaccineThese figures indicate a risk of waning immunity for the third vaccine dose as time progressesThe findings are supported by another recent study from Israel that also found natural immunity waned significantly more slowly compared to artificial or vaccinated immunity The study found that both natural and artificial immunity waned over timeIndividuals that were previously infected but not vaccinated had half the risks of reinfection as compared to those that were vaccinated with two doses but not infectedNatural immunity wins again Dr Martin Adel Makary a public policy researcher at Johns Hopkins University wrote on Twitter referring to the Israeli studyAmong persons who had been previously infected with SARSCoV2 protection against reinfection decreased as the time increased the authors concluded however this protection was higher than protection conferred in the same time interval through two doses of the vaccine""",LeadStories,fake,1,248

chosen to hear the case against Newsom listened intently as Rear Adm Darse E Crandall systematically and meticulously described what he called Newsoms Covid Crimes a nexus of egregious felonies that began shortly after the disgraced governor received from the NIHCDC a letter instructing him to lockdown the State of CaliforniaWe need all sympathetic parties onboard with the program immediately You must take all steps possible to enforce mandatory lockdowns and mask mandates especially in your most densely populated cities The people must believe that Covid19 is the greatest threat humanity has ever faced and they must be convinced to follow our mandates with the belief that they will become gravely ill or die if they refuse The mechanisms for enforcing this change have been in place for years and now we act Its equally important to inflate the Covid19 mortality rate however you see fit to instill dread and fear among an already frightened publicYour compliance is appreciated and expected part of the letter readThe letter was dated March 16 2020 three days before Newsom issued a statewide shelterinplace order and was digitally signed by former NIH and CDC honchos Drs Francis Collins and Robert Redfield respectively At the time the California Dept of Public Health had attributed 31 deaths to Covid19After showing the authenticated letter to the panel Rear Adm Crandall introduced a witness for the prosecution Dr Grady Armando a former ER doctor at Southern California Hospital at Culver City who appeared on ZOOM to discuss the causes of death for 5 patients who died on 17 MarchIt was a rough night for us working trauma Three young men were brought to us with multiple gunshot wounds In laymans terms they were in bad shape and I knew right out saving them would be an uphill battle We did our best but all three expired Dr Armando saidRear Adm Crandall showed the panel copies of the death certificates The primary cause of death on each was given as Covid19These are your signatures Dr Armando on the certificates attesting to the fact that Covid19 killed these menand each took between two and five gunshot woundsIt is my signature Its the responsibility of the doctor who last treated a patient to sign a death certificate within 15 hours listing the date time and cause of death Dr Armando saidLooking at these comparing the times of death against the time you signed themit seems like you signed them within minutes Rear Adm Crandall saidI did Dr Armando saidForgive my naivety here but perhaps you can explain something So you took in 3 gunshot victims were desperately fighting to save their lives they died and you had an opportunity to list their causes of death as Covid19 before you had a chance it seems to even wash your hands of their blood Rear Adm Crandall saidDr Armando fell silent a moment then said We were instructed to put Covid19 on death certificatesInstructed by whom Rear Adm Crandall askedCalifornia Dept of Health and hospital administration Dr Armando saidWas there any evidence the gunshot victims had Covid19 A PCR test for example Rear Adm Crandall saidNot really Dr Armando repliedExplain not really please if you would Rear Adm Crandall saidWe were instructed to list Covid19 as a primary cause of death if a patient presented symptoms of respiratory distresscoughing sneezing gasping for air shortness of breath Dr Armando saidIs it not likely Dr Armando that a person with a gunshot would be coughingcoughing up blood or gasping for air Rear Adm Crandall askedThat would be probable Dr Armando repliedLets get to the meat of the matter You declared patients dead of Covid19 knowing it was not the actual cause of death Rear Adm Crandall queriedI regret what Ive done I knew it was unethical and illegal We were told to treat all such cases as presumptive positive and told it was pointless to test for Covid19 posthumously Dr Armando saidAnd this was widespread based on your conversation with your colleagues at the time Rear Adm Crandall saidIt was endemic Dr Armando saidThis commission appreciates your candor Youre excused for now Rear Adm Crandall saidThe doctors testimony stirred Newsom to life He arose from the chair in which he had been sitting and began chastising the commission for accepting testimony from a witness who had not once named him a party to the alleged crimesThis is absurd Newsom blurted Even if true which it isnt what does it have to do with me Ive never heard any of these lies before today Every action I took was to save the lives of people in my state and help protect a nation from a virulent disease Dr Armando is clearly delusionalThe next witness however refuted Newsoms claims of ignorance Muntu Davis MD MPH chief health officer for Los Angeles County said under direct examination that Gavin Newsom had in March 2020 compelled him under threat of ruining his career to artificially exaggerate Covid19 fatalities He testified under oath that Newsom wanted between 12002000 new cases and between 100150 Covid fatalities per day enough to monumentally strike enough fear in the public so that every citizen of Los Angeles County would be clamoring to get vaccinated Furthermore Dr Davis said Newsom had set quotas for each county in the state a metric whereby health officials would face debasement and termination unless they signed onto the program and manufactured Covid19 cases and fatalitiesAnd you went along with this Rear Adm Crandall asked himWe all did It was our job right or wrong The entire health industry across the state and the nation went along with it and are still doing it today Get people to wear masks get them to take untested and unproven vaccines that might sicken or kill them and get them dependent on government support That has always been the agenda Dr Munto saidAs Rear Adm Crandall was about to introduce his next witness Tam Ma Deputy Legislative Secretary at Office of Governor Gavin Newsom the 3officer panel said it had heard sufficient evidence to declare a verdict of guilty It found Gavin Newsom guilty of treason and child sex crimes and recommended that he be executed for his transgressionsYou cant fucking

protect the brain against diseases and harmful substances are not immune cells as had previously been thought but instead likely arise from the lining of the circulatory systemThis basic science finding may have implications for understanding agerelated decline in brain functioning and how HIV infects brain cellsThe study appearing online in eLife was conducted by researchers at NIHs Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development NICHD and National Human Genome Research Institute and the Japanese National Institute of GeneticsThe bloodbrain barrier is the layer of cells that line the blood vessels of the brain The inner cell layer that lines vessels known as the endothelium is present in all the blood vessels of the body Within the blood vessels of the brain endothelial cells and other adjacent cells form a tight barrier that helps to prevent toxins and microbes from entering the brain Although their function is not completely understood a special population of cells covering the blood vessels on the brains surface is thought to contribute to the organs protection The cells act as sentries engulfing toxins cellular wastes and microbes and then encasing them in spherelike structures called vesicles These sentry cells are called fluorescent granular perithelial cells FGPs because the vesicles they contain give off a yellow glow in the presence of lightIn the current study the researchers showed that FGPs are present on the surface of the zebrafish brain and that these blood vesselassociated FGPs do not arise from the immune system as had been previously thought but from endothelial cells themselvesFGPs are thought to be important in a variety of human brain disorders and conditions These cells appear to be a major entry point for HIV infection of the brain Agerelated decline in cognitive function is associated with a decline in the scavenging function of FGPs Learning more about how FGPs function may lead to a greater understanding of dementia and other conditions said the studys senior author Brant Weinstein PhD of NICHDs Section on Vertebrate OrganogenesisThe Weinstein lab studies zebrafish to understand how the blood and lymphatic systems develop Because the young fish are transparent it is possible to see the developing circulatory system while observing the fish under a light microscope As part of this effort Dr Weinstein and his colleagues inserted a gene for a protein that turns green into the cells that line the endothelium of selected embryonic veins and in the lymphatic system  the network of vessels through which immune cells travel in the body In addition to seeing green lymphatic cells in the zebrafish embryos the researchers noticed that green cells also covered the surface of the tiny fishs brainsUpon closer inspection the researchers tentatively identified these cells as FGPs Because they turned green it was apparent that they arose from endothelial cells Until the current study FGPs were thought to be macrophages a type of immune cell The researchers conducted additional experiments to confirm the origins of the FGPs including analyzing what proteins were being made by their DNA These proteins most closely resembled those made by endothelial cells in the lymphatic system not the proteins made by macrophages or other immune cells In another series of experiments they inserted a green fluorescent protein into the tissues that give rise to blood and lymph vessels in embryonic zebrafish Using time lapse photography the researchers captured images of FGPs arising from the vessels endothelium When zebrafish with the green fluorescing endothelial gene matured the researchers observed green FGPs on the surface of the fishs brains  confirming that these cells arose from endothelial tissueThe researchers hope to conduct further studies of how FGPs interact with blood vessels and the bloodbrain barrier The researchers noted that unlike mammals embryonic zebrafish can be observed under a microscope as they develop providing an easy means for studying the role of FGPs in protecting the brainAbout the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and

the virus preventing its replication in the mouth and throatThe scientists say there is an urgent need to test the effectiveness of mouthwash in trials although there is currently no clinical evidence that it would be successfulThe World Health Organisation has already said There is no evidence that using mouthwash will protect you from infection with the new coronavirusThe study authors do not say that current commerciallyavailable mouthwash prevents COVID19 but that further research into mouthwash chemicals could be beneficialReadily available dental mouthwashes have the potential to destroy the lipid envelope of coronaviruses combating virus replication in the mouth and throatWriting in Function the study authors led by Cardiff University say oral rinses are an underresearched area of

Barcelona and Cambridges Babraham InstituteSafe use of mouthwash  as in gargling  has so far not been considered by public health bodies in the UK said lead author Professor ODonnell codirector of Cardiff Universitys Systems Immunity Research InstituteIn test tube experiments and limited clinical studies some mouthwashes contain enough of known virucidal ingredients to effectively target lipids in similar enveloped virusesWhat we dont know yet is whether existing mouthwashes are active against the lipid membrane of SARSCoV2Our review of the literature suggests that research is needed as a matter of urgency to determine its potential for use against this new virusThis is an underresearched area of major clinical need  and we hope that research projects will be quickly mobilised to further evaluate thisCoronavirus is a type of enveloped virus meaning it has an outer lipid membrane that could be damaged by chemicals in mouthwash Naked viruses lack the viral envelopeThe ingredients of dental mouthwashes including chlorhexidine cetylpyridinium chloride hydrogen peroxide and povidoneiodine all have the potential to prevent infection and several deserve clinical evaluation according to the researchersIn particular these chemicals disrupt the outer lipid membrane known as the viral envelope or lipid envelope of the SARSCoV2 virus which causes COVID19The lipid envelope helps several viruses including coronaviruses bind to human cells while avoiding the host immune systemSpecific spike proteins called glycoproteins on the surface of the envelope identify and bind to receptor sites on the hosts cell membrane which allows infectionMouthwash chemicals could potentially modify the ability of the spike glycoproteins to interact with receptors on host cellsThe researchers said there had so far been no discussion about the potential role of damaging the fatty membrane as a possible way to inactivate the virusThe lipid envelope does not change when viruses mutate meaning mouthwash could still work against any new coronavirus strains that emerge from this pandemicThe WHO has previously debunked the suggestion that mouthwash can prevent infection by SARS CoV2 the coronavirus that causes COVID19Some brands of mousthwash can eliminate certain microbes for a few minutes in the saliva in your mouth it saidHowever this does not mean they protect you from

1007,1324,"""Scientists uncover brain circuits behind putting up a fight or freezing in placeNIHfunded study may provide clues to disorders including anxiety and phobiasIn a study of mice National Institutes of Healthfunded researchers describe a new circuit involved in finetuning the brains decision either to hide or confront threats The study published in Nature was partially funded by the NIHs Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies BRAIN InitiativeBeing able to manipulate specific circuits can uncover surprising relationships between brain areas and provide great insight into how the sensory emotional and behavioral centers work together to drive reactions said Jim Gnadt PhD program director at the NIHs National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS and a team lead for the BRAIN Initiative The tools and technologies developed through the BRAIN Initiative have made studies such as this one possibleA team of researchers led by Andrew Huberman PhD professor of neurobiology and of ophthalmology at Stanford University in California investigated the role of the ventral midline thalamus vMT in determining how animals respond to visual threats The thalamus is a brain region that acts as a relay station taking in sensory information such as what is seen and heard and sorting out where in the brain to send that informationDr Huberman and his colleagues showed that the vMT was activated when mice were confronted with a threat specifically a black circle that grew larger on top of their cage mimicking the experience of something looming over them When faced with the looming threat the mice spent most of the time freezing or hiding and very little time rattling their tails which is typically an aggressive responseTo further investigate the role of vMT Dr Hubermans team used stateoftheart tools including designer drugs that allowed specific circuits to be turned on and off Although inactivating the vMT had no effect on freezing and hiding it eliminated the tail rattling response Turning on the vMT increased the number of tail shaking responses and caused the mice to move around more and spend less time hiding or freezingDr Hubermans group also discovered that the vMT sends information primarily to two brain areas the basolateral amygdala BLA and the medial prefrontal cortex mPFC These circuits turned out to be critical in determining how the mice reacted to a visual threat Turning on the circuit that projected to the BLA caused more freezing responses while activating the mPFC circuit increased tail shaking responsesDr Hubermans work is opening a new area of vision research with the looming threat model helping us understand how circuitry in the brain works from sensation to behavior said Thomas Greenwell PhD program director at the NIHs National Eye Institute which cofunded the studyDr Huberman and his team showed that activation of the vMT increased arousal a state of heightened alertness Mice preferred spending more time in a room where they received vMT activation suggesting that turning on that brain circuit made them feel good Although there may have been a difference in response to the visual threat either tail shaking or freezing the underlying positive feeling was the same for both types of reactionsThis study may help explain why acts of courage such as standing up for yourself or for a cause or a physical challenge can feel empowering Experiencing that good feeling can also make it more likely to respond to future threats in a similar way said Dr Huberman Although our study was done in mice learning more about the vMT may provide some insight into conditions such as generalized anxiety disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder and we are now pursuing study of the human vMT for that reasonFuture research is needed to increase understanding of ways in which the vMT circuit affects behavior and how to develop treatments that can target specific parts of this

prehistoric viruses As the ancient frozen ground slowly loses its perma label due to rising temperatures more and more microbes that have never encountered modern humans are resurfacing The researchers coined the isntthatjustgreat term zombie viruses to describe previously dormant viruses that had been frozen in ice for tens of thousands of years  27000 to 48500 years in fact The first question is obvious This is fascinating but is it a good idea Were still dealing with a certain mutating virus our immune systems have never encountered before The second question What does it mean No Humans Were Harmed in This Study The quick answer The viruses observed here were only able to infect amoebae But viruses that can infect humans do indeed exist in environments like permafrost The possibility that an unearthed unknown virus will one day appear from seemingly nowhere and result in another pandemic is not necessarily zero There is an objective risk and it is increasing says JeanMichel Claverie PhD the lead researcher and an emeritus professor of genomics and bioinformatics at AixMarseille University in France However we cannot put a number on this probability specifically because we refuse to work with and revive human and animalinfecting viruses It would be much too dangerous Based on Claverie and his teams results human and animalinfecting viruses can indeed survive deep within the permafrost for extended periods of time From our research we can deduce that other viruses present in the permafrost are likely still infectious says Claverie By sequencing the total DNA we can detect the presence of viruses similar to those infecting animals or humans today That said the chances of something catastrophic happening from say humans exposed to thawed permafrost are slim The microbes would be quick to decay once theyre exposed to heat UV light and oxygen he saysAlso in places like Siberia where permafrost exists people generally do not So some science fictioninspired fears we see you fans of John Carpenters The Thing are pretty unfounded But if more people or companies begin to migrate toward the areas where these microbes are being released the chances of a virus successfully infecting a host could be greater So what would happen  hypothetically  if the next deadly virus to overtake our planet came from the Arctic permafrost Would we even be remotely prepared There is a small risk that a frozen virus that gets unearthed is able to start an infection chain that ends up in humans says Adrian Liston PhD an immunologist and senior group leader at the Babraham Institute a life sciences research institute at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom Liston was not involved in the research discussed here On the one hand we would not have preexisting immunity against it so the initial ability to combat the infection is low On the other hand the virus would not be adapted to infect modernday humans so the chance of an initial infection being successful for the virus is extremely low Thats something a lot of folks dont understand Todays viruses and other infectious microbes are infectious only because they exist today They have evolved to work within our modern immune systems  either for good or ill Entry events do happen very rarely and they can shape human evolution says Liston Major examples would be smallpox a virus and tuberculosis a bacteria which strongly influenced human evolution when they entered our species selecting for the type of immune system that was able to fight them and killing off individuals with the wrong type of immune system And not all organisms are harmful There are many many microbes that are beneficial to humans Liston says But generally speaking these are microbes that have evolved for millions of years to work in harmony with our body such as our microbiome or have been selected for thousands of years to do beneficial chores for us like yeast in making bread or brewing beerSome random frozen microbe is unlikely to impact us directly but if it does it is far more likely to be bad Liston says For now at least we can rest easy knowing that Claverie and his team have no plans to revive dangerous viruses or retrieve more samples Because of the RussianUkrainian war all of our collaborations have stopped We are now focused on studying the viruses already in our lab and understand how they replicate and interact with their cellular hosts he says If anything zombie viruses can at least remind us about the constant increasing effects that climate change will have on our lives and planet in the near future The most important takehome message is that climate change is going to create unexpected problems says Liston It isnt simply changes to weather climate events and sea levels rising A whole cascade of secondary problems will be generated New infections some of which could go pandemic are almost certainly going to happen because of climate

1076,1529,"""Tools to diagnose Alzheimers disease and latent tuberculosis are among the winning projects in the Design by Biomedical Undergraduate Teams DEBUT challenge a biomedical engineering design prize competition for teams of undergraduate students The teams developed prototypes of devices that advance technology and improve human health The DEBUT challenge with prizes worth 65000 is supported by a publicprivate partnership between the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering NIBIB part of the National Institutes of Health and VentureWell a nonprofit highereducation network that cultivates revolutionary ideas and promising inventions This is the second year that NIBIB has joined with VentureWell extending the collective reach and impact of the DEBUT awardsOf the 41 eligible entries received from 22 universities in 16 different states NIBIB selected three winning teams based on the significance of the problem being addressed the impact on clinical care the innovation of the design and the evidence of a working prototype VentureWell selected two additional teams based on market potential and patentability The prizes will be awarded in a ceremony at the annual Biomedical Engineering Society BMES conference in Phoenix on October 12thUndergraduates are the future of biomedical research said NIBIB Director Roderic I Pettigrew PhD MD The winning teams illustrate how fresh perspectives can solve old problems in creative ways We are pleased to join with VentureWell to encourage undergraduates to create new and viable technologies that can be taken from bench to bedside This year the sixth of the competition is especially inspiring because many of the DEBUT projects were among some of the most promising solutions to healthcare problems we have seenNIBIBs first place prize of 20000 went to a team from the University of Maryland College Park that developed a device to help diagnose Alzheimers disease Currently PET scans MRIs and spinal taps are the most commonly used methods to diagnose Alzheimers disease These methods are expensive and can be invasive and so many patients are diagnosed based only on their symptoms This can mean that up to 50 percent of Alzheimers patients do not receive a proper diagnosis and therefore dont have adequate access to treatment care or supportThe winning project incorporates a portable electroencephalogram EEG that uses a specially designed headset and a new software analysis tool to achieve detection of Alzheimers disease before clinical symptoms are displayed The device exploits changes observed in the brainwaves of Alzheimers patients in response to special auditory tones The end result is a noninvasive and relatively inexpensive tool with the potential to detect Alzheimers disease with a high level of accuracy The device could make dementia diagnosis more quantitative systematic and less costly  allowing doctors to use it at regular checkupsZeynep Erim PhD program director managing the DEBUT challenge at NIBIB said the project impressed the judges not only with its potential for high impact on a large portion of the elderly population but also with the wide range of competencies it incorporated The team demonstrated skills in electronic and mechanical design as well as in implementing software to process EEG signals and detect Alzheimerrelated changes in the brainwaves using machine learning algorithms she saidThe second place NIBIB prize of 15000 was awarded to a team from Arizona State University Tempe for developing a 3D trackingassisted functional regionmapping tool to help doctors performing brain surgery while a patient is awake Operating on an awake patient is often required for epilepsy and glioma surgeries Doctors must determine the precise location of critical brain regions that control motor vision and language functions by stimulating a region and observing the patients response Currently to tag the identified regions they use sterile paper which is imprecise time consuming and prone to accidental displacementThis new device would digitize the brain mapping process and allow doctors to simultaneously test whether the brain tissue controls a critical area and apply digital tags to the surface of the brain The digital tag system would provide physical auditory and visual warning cues when certain surgical tools encroach on tagged areas so the surgeon knows where the targeted areas are as well as those to avoid This would allow the surgeon to operate without looking away from the surgical process while still being aware of the location of critical brain regionsNIBIBs third place prize for 10000 was awarded to a team from Johns Hopkins University Baltimore for their device called Treyetch It was designed to facilitate the insertion of healthy cornea tissue grafts to replace damaged tissue in a corneal transplant procedure called Descemets Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty The operation can completely restore a patients vision but is difficult to perform correctly because corneal tissue is fragile easily damaged upon contact and tends to fold up on itself once inserted The Treyetech technology trifolds the tissue and places it in a special inserter device before it reaches the operating room Then surgeons use the inserter to place the tissue without damaging it Once in place it naturally unfolds by itself thanks to the special trifolding The tool could help reduce the total time of surgery and limit potential problemsThe Venture Prize of 15000 was awarded by VentureWell to a team from George Mason University Fairfax Virginia who designed a device to diagnose latent tuberculosis LTBI According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention onethird of the worlds population is estimated to have some form of tuberculosis TB Many of those people have LTBI  which means they do not currently have an active infection but may develop it in the near or remote future a process called TB reactivation To fully eliminate its incidence a reliable and inexpensive method to identify those with LTBI is needed Current diagnostic tests available to individuals at risk for latent and active tuberculosis are invasive requiring blood sample or an injection expensive and time consuming The team developed a paperbased immunoassay that uses nanoparticles to identify tuberculosis biomarkers in a urine sample This could make diagnosis simple and inexpensive and help health professionals limit the spread of the diseaseVentureWells Design Excellence Prize of 5000 went to a team from Johns Hopkins University for the AssistENT a comfortable and discreet nasal dilator that can be inserted into obstructed nostrils to open the airways and facilitate breathing Current nasal dilators are intended to be used only during sleeping hours can be difficult to use and are uncomfortable after prolonged use They are also visible making it unlikely that those needing help breathing during the day would use them The AssistENT device is made from flexible formfitting materials that do not cause discomfort It is also not visible when in use eliminating the social stigma associated with existing dilators AssistENT the first intranasal dilator that is fully suitable for use during the day and it could present a viable alternative to reconstructive surgery to enhance nasal breathingThis years submissions represent a broad cross section of universities and colleges and demonstrate the diversity of approaches to improving health and healthcare outcomes VentureWell CEO Phil Weilerstein said Submissions went through rigorous external review by panels of industry and technical experts The volume of high quality submissions made the selection of the awardees a challenging process The winners of the Venture and Design Excellence prizes are addressing the diagnosis and treatment of two major challenges The sophistication of their solutions and the potential that these innovations represent demonstrates the impact of bringing the focus of BME undergraduates to real world needsDescriptions and videos of the winning projects can be found here

on Thanksgiving Day 2019 when her husband Matthew took his life The couple had just moved from Minneapolis to Charlotte where Matt took a new position in a private practice He felt the move had been a mistake and referred to it as career suicide Gall says I wanted him to get help and take antidepressants but he was afraid of losing his medical license if he took medication A few months after moving he ended his life Lynette Eddy a Reno NVbased social worker lost her husband to suicide in 2010 I watched Bob depart from his own value system over the years giving up on his true self she says Unfortunately he was swayed by money and greed got involved with gambling and got in over his head I had no idea of the life he was leading but I know he was suffering greatly Both Gall and Eddy had to find ways to heal and rebuild their lives in the wake of the selfinflicted death of a husband Losing a loved one to suicide is a loss like no other says Julie Cerel PhD professor at the University of Kentucky College of Social Work and director of the Suicide Prevention and Exposure Lab Unlike other causes of death like illnesses or accidents which happen to the person suicide is an act performed by the person who has chosen death leaving bereaved survivors with guilt and haunting questions says Cerel who is the coauthor of Seeking Hope Stories of the Suicide Bereaved When you lose someone to suicide you instantaneously become an investigator Gall says Why did it happen What did I miss What could I have done differently Everyone who knew my husband was asking themselves the same questions We all blamed ourselves in some way feeling that we should have been able to anticipate or stop it says GallEddy agrees Survivors guilt is super common I look back and asked myself the same questions a million times Sometimes according to Cerel we really dont know what motivated the person Gall now realizes there was nothing else we could have done Mental health issues are excruciatingly difficult People have to be willing to help themselves and we cant force them Matt refused to go on antidepressants and there was no way I could make him do so Eddy has reached a similar conclusion I feel he had some serious things going on and it didnt matter what we did or didnt do I got him to go to counseling but that didnt work I tried to get him to open up but never got the truth out of him I know he was suffering and can only imagine how tortured he was Obviously I would have done anything I could have done to alleviate that but he wouldnt let me in Research comparing suicidebereaved people to people who have sustained other losses has found higher levels of shame stigma and feeling the need to hide the loved ones cause of death Secrecy often develops both within the family and toward people outside the family and can lead to family dysfunction Withdrawing from social networks and friends can make mourning and recovery more difficult Many people bereaved by suicide are reluctant to tell others about the cause of death or to talk about it Cerel says But our research has found that being able to talk openly about the death and the loved one is actually very helpful Gall and Eddy have spoken openly about their losses And both have written books describing their experience Gall is the author of The Illusion of the Perfect Profession and Eddy is the author of The Fight Inside Both hope that their books will pave the way for deeper understanding of why people might end their lives and how families can cope with such a major lossFamily members dont have to reveal personal details but memorializing the deceased and allowing people to offer love and support helps with feeling less alone and reduces stigma Grief researcher Katherine Shear MD writes Mourning is the process by which bereaved people seek and find ways to turn the light on in the world again Mourning is normal and healthy following loss But suicide can lead to complicated grief also called prolonged grief which can prevent the natural healing process from progressing Some people feel anger rejection or betrayal when their loved one dies by suicide which can compound their sense of guilt and place them at greater risk for complicated grief But not everyone reacts that way People say to me you must be so angry at your husband he betrayed you he lied but I never did get angry and Im not angry today Eddy says She attributes her reaction to her spiritual practice which has enabled her to see through the heart into her husbands pain I know he was suffering greatly and trying to fill a void with quickfix pleasure Cerel encourages suicidebereaved people to seek professional help if necessary They often have symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder or even fullblown PTSD even if they werent there to see the actual event happen There are effective treatments for PTSD and complicated grief as well as other aspects of suiciderelated grief like anger and guilt Support groups are also helpful particularly consisting of people bereaved by suicide Resources can be found at the end of the article Its taken thousands of hours on my therapists couch to realize that my husband had no more control over his mental illness than his cancer patients had over their cancer Gall says Ive accepted that and no longer wake up every morning with that thud in my heart and that searing searing pain that goes along with the kind of grief I had Not only family but also friends classmates community members and coworkers can be devastated by a suicide Cerel points out Getting professional help or joining a support group can be valuable for them tooGall and Eddy draw upon their spiritual practice for comfort and strength Faith in a higher power is where I turned first says Gall Ive always been a Christian but didnt go to church every Sunday and wasnt extremely religious In the months before her husbands death and since then shes turned to the Bible and to devotional readings for some sort of road map as to how to get through the most tumultuous confusing awful torturous chaotic time of my life Eddy also draws on her spiritual practice  A Course in Miracles  and mindfulnessbased approaches The spiritual path I took started years before this even happened and played a huge role in giving me strength The phrase from A Course in Miracles that had a profound impact on her was Nothing real can be threatened Nothing unreal exists Therein lies the peace of God In other words I feel that theres an outside drama happening I can be one of the actors in the play or I can watch the play and be the observer Eddy developed OpenHeart Mindfulness an approach that involves observing and witnessing feelings thoughts and reactions without becoming judgmental She says everyone has an ego voice that can drive them to despair as happened to my husband But everyone also has another voice  the spirit voice  and we can tune in to that and release our suffering She advises others Grieve of course but dont be identified with the grief Stay in the witness seat Understand and be gentle with yourself and recognize that healing will take time Spirituality and mindfulnessbased approaches dont resonate with everyone Cerel points out Spiritual practices are very individual Faith or mindfulness may be exactly what some people need but not others There are many paths And mindfulness doesnt necessarily mean meditation Any activity demanding close attention  for example exercise art music even horseback riding  can bring that quality to the fore As horrific as the experience is of losing a loved one to suicide some people emerge changed for the better which is often called posttraumatic growth says CerelI think anyone whos had a traumatic experience that brought them to their knees and stripped them down to the core has a decision to make says Eddy I had identified as Bobs wife and he was my rock and everything was about him Then all of a sudden that was gone and I knew I had to reinvent myself rebuild my life and do something positive Eddy who completed her MSW after the death of her husband was working with homeless teenagers and decided to open up a facility Eddys House for this vulnerable population It was a deep feeling I had in my spirit as a way of helping young people Its been a big healer for me She teaches OpenHeart Mindfulness to the teens and feels its made a difference in their lives Writing her book contributed to healing Eddy wanted to shed light on the inner conflicts that had led her husband to die by suicide and to get the reader to see how collectively we have to move toward our authentic selves Gall wrote her book not only as a way of processing her loss but also to highlight forces that might drive a doctor to suicide Im sharing my story and Matts experience to open up a conversation because our medical system is broken Gall has been able to start feeling joy again Life is so precious and I feel blessed that I had such a beautiful life with Matthew and I still have a beautiful life even without him Difficult some days but we must move forward You never move on  you only move forward If you are having

syndrome and others as a cause of death or a contributing factor They matched these certificates to medical records with a code related to COVID19 They identified 3544 Americans who died from long COVID from Jan 1 2020 through June 30 2022 This group is a fraction of the 102 million people who died from COVID19 during that time Their findings are published in the December 2022 CDC Vital Statistics Rapid Release report I think the studys fascinating and interesting It brings perspective to the consequences of COVID even after weve finished focusing on the acute infection itself says Thomas Gut DO associate chair of medicine and medical director of the PostCOVID Recovery Center at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City Its still early days he says This is just the tip of the iceberg  for the consequences that were going to be facing long term Regarding the 3500 deaths I think its a low number overall Gut says Theres probably a lot more people that have died We probably missed a lot of long COVID early on not realizing thats what it wasIts unlikely death certificates earlier in the pandemic would include the acute COVID infection as a cause of death 3 to 6 months later for example Gut says Going forward this could change Long COVID is a chronic condition so its more likely to be listed on a death certificate More than half of the deaths linked to long COVID 57 occurred in people ages 75 and older Also men accounted for 515 of long COVID deaths Furthermore 79 of long COVID deaths were nonHispanic white people followed by 10 nonHispanic Black people and about 8 Hispanic people Even though nonHispanic American IndianAlaska Native people experienced less than 2 of all the long COVID deaths in the study they emerged as a highrisk group in a separate analysis Their ageadjusted death rate for long COVID was highest at 148 deaths per 1 million people In contrast nonHispanic Asian people had the lowest ageadjusted death rate at 15 per 1 million Minority groups like American Indians and Alaska Natives have been disproportionately affected by the virus from the beginning of the pandemic  and have been also among the harder to reach and to provide access to the vaccine Schaffner says This report shows that efforts to reach these underserved communities continues to be essential he says We need to keep doing that  and if we needed another reason to do that here it is The CDC researchers propose a bleak reason why higher death rates from long COVID were not found among nonHispanic Black and Hispanic people in the study despite these groups having higher COVID19 mortality rates Many COVID19 patients in these groups likely died of their original disease before they could develop long COVID Although the medical community continues to learn and acknowledge the burden of long COVID and health care professionals have been using the term more there is lots of variability since we still do not a have a unified diagnosis of this illness  The fact that the number of long COVID labeled deaths has been increasing over time could be a result of more awareness among the medical community and therefore make it very challenging to draw specific conclusions from this study says Fidaa Shaib MD an associate professor of medicine in the section of pulmonary critical care and sleep medicine and director of the Post COVID Care Clinic at Baylor College of Medicine in HoustonEven though the study found more deaths among men our experience and the experience of others have shown that PASC postacute sequelae of COVID or long COVID patients are predominantly middleaged women Shaib points out some limitations of the study Some causes of long COVID deaths could be from other disorders  like heart disease  that increase the risk of death from acute COVID19 itself Also the data did not include information about the length of time from the original COVID19 illness to the time of death Therefore the PASClong COVID diagnosis might not be very accurate Overall this study is a good start to draw more attention about the seriousness of acute and long COVID illnesses Shaib says but more specific data is needed Avoiding COVID19 in the first place remains the best protection against long COVID Schaffner says Like many public health officials he emphasized the importance of staying up to date on COVID vaccinations as the most effective strategy As a population the United States has really not taken sufficient advantage of the freely available  and really quite effective  boosters that are out there now The latest CDC estimates report that 135 of Americans 5 years and older have received an updated booster dose For this reason we need to really to keep the pedal on the metal trying to get the message out Schaffner says In this holiday season the best gift you can give yourself and to the members of your family your loved ones and friends is to get the booster  and bring some of them along when you get the vaccine so that they can get the booster also""",WebMD,real,0,1377

analyzing the data a team of researchers spanning several Brazilian institutes the University of Toronto and Columbias EAFIT concluded in a December preprint study that hospitalization and mortality rates were cut in half over the seven month period among the Ivermectin groupThis is even more impressive when you learn the IVM users were older on average with 30 50 yo versus 20 for nonIVM users

great satisfaction our very long intimacy as fellowlabourers in the same cause the recent expressions of mutual confidence which had preceded your mission the interesting course which that had taken  particularly  personally as it regarded yourself made me anxious to hear from you on your return I was the more so too as I had myself during the whole of your absence as well as since your return been a constant butt for every shaft of calumny which malice  falsehood could form  the presses public speakers or private letters disseminate one of these too was of a nature to touch yourself as if wanting confidence in your efforts I had been capable of usurping powers committed to you  authorising negociations private  collateral to yours the real truth is that though Dr Logan the pretended missionary2 about 4 or 5 days before he sailed for Hamburgh told me he was going there  thence to Paris  asked  recieved from me a certificate of his citizenship character  circumstances of life merely as a protection should he be molested on his journey in the present turbulent  suspicious state of Europe yet3 I had been led to consider his object as relative to his private affairs and tho from an intimacy of some standing he knew well my wishes for peace and my political sentiments in general he nevertheless4 recieved then no particular declaration of them no authority to communicate them to any mortal nor to speak to any one in my name or in any bodys name on that or any other subject what ever5 nor did I write by him a scrip of a pen to any person what ever this he has himself honestly  publicly declared since his return  from his well known character  every other6 circumstance every candid man must percieve that his enterprize was dictated by his own enthusiasm without consultation or communication with any one that he acted in Paris on his own ground  made his own way yet to give some colour to his proceedings which might implicate the republicans in general  myself particularly7 they have not been ashamed to bring forward a supposititious paper drawn by one of their own party in the name of Logan  falsely pretended to have been presented by him to the government of France counting that the bare8 mention of my9 name therein would connect that in the eye of the public with this transaction in confutation of these  all future calumnies by way of anticipation I shall make to you a profession of my political faith in confidence that you will consider every future imputation on me of a contrary complexion as bearing on its front the mask of falsehood  calumnyI do then with sincere zeal wish an inviolable preservation of our present federal constitution according to the true sense in which it was adopted10 by the states that in which it was advocated by its friends  not that which its enemies apprehended who therefore became its enemies and I am opposed to the monarchising its features by the forms of its administration with a view to conciliate a first transition to a President  Senate for life  from that to a hereditary tenure of these offices  thus to worm out the elective principle I am for preserving to the states the powers not yielded by them to the Union11  to the legislature of the Union its constitutional share in the division of powers and I am not for transferring all the powers of the states to the general government  all those of that government to the Executive branch I am for a government rigorously frugal  simple applying all the possible savings of the public revenue to the discharge of the national debt and not for a multiplication of officers  salaries merely to make partizans  for increasing by every device the public debt on the principle of its being a public blessing I am for relying for internal defence on our militia solely till actual invasion and for such a naval force only as may protect our coasts and harbours from such depredations as we have experienced and not for a standing army in time of peace which may overawe the public sentiment nor for a navy which by its own expences and the eternal wars in which it will implicate us will grind us with public burthens  sink us under them I am for free commerce with all nations political connection with none  little or no12 diplomatic establishment and I am not for linking ourselves by new treaties13 with the quarrels of Europe entering that field of slaughter to preserve their14 balance or joining in the confederacy of kings to war against the principles of liberty I am for freedom of religion  against all maneuvres to bring about a legal ascendancy of one sect over another15 for freedom of the press  against all violations of the constitution to silence by force  not by reason16 the complaints or criticisms just or unjust of our citizens against the conduct of their agents and I am for encouraging the progress of science in all its branches and not for raising a hue and cry against the sacred name of philosophy for awing17 the human mind by stories of rawhead  bloody bones to a distrust of its own vision  to repose implicitly on that of others to go backwards instead of forwards to look for improvement to believe that government religion morality  every other science were in the highest perfection in ages of the darkest ignorance and that nothing can ever be devised more perfect than what was established by18 our forefathers to these I will add that I was a sincere wellwisher to the success of the French revolution and still wish it may end in the establishment of a free  well ordered republic19 but I have not been insensible under the atrocious depredations they have committed on our commerce the first object of my heart is my own country in that is embarked my family my fortune  my own existence I have not one farthing of interest nor one fibre of attachment out of it nor a single motive of preference of any one nation to another but in proportion as they are more or less friendly to us but though deeply feeling the injuries of France I did not think war the surest mode of redressing them I did believe that a mission sincerely disposed to preserve peace would obtain for us a peaceable  honourable settlement and retribution  I appeal to you to say whether this might not have been obtained if either of your collegues had been of the same sentiment with20 yourselfthese my friend are my principles they are unquestionably the principles of the great body of our fellow citizens21 and I know there is not one22 of them which is not yours also in truth we never differed but on one ground the funding system and as from the moment of its being adopted by the constituted authorities I became religiously principled in the sacred discharge of it to the uttermost farthing we are now united even on that single ground of differenceI turn now to your enquiries the inclosed paper will answer one of them but you also ask for such political information as may be possessed by me  interesting to yourself in regard to your embassy as a proof of my entire confidence in you I shall give it fully  candidly when Pinckney Marshal and Dana were nominated to settle our differences with France it was suspected by many from what was understood23 of their dispositions that their mission would not result in a settlement of differences but would produce circumstances tending to widen the breach and to provoke our citizens to consent to a war with that nation  union with England Danas resignation  your appointment gave the first gleam of hope of a peaceable issue to the mission for it was believed that you were sincerely disposed to accomodation  it was not long after your arrival there before symptoms were observed of that difference of views which had been suspected to existIn the mean time however24 the aspect of our government towards the French republic25 had become so ardent that the people of America generally took the alarm to the Southward their apprehensions were early excited in the Eastern states also they at length began to break out meetings were held in many of your towns  addresses to the government agreed on in opposition to war the example was spreading like wild fire other meetings were called in other places  a general concurrence of sentiment against the apparent inclinations of the government was imminent when most critically for the government the dispatches of Oct 22 prepared26 by your collegue Marshall with a view to their being made public27 dropped into their laps it was truly a Godsend to them  they made the most of it many thousands of copies were printed  dispersed gratis at the public expence  the zealots for war cooperated so heartily that there were instances of single individuals who printed  dispersed 10 or 12000 copies at their own expence the odiousness of the28 corruption supposed29 in those papers excited a general  high indignation among the people unexperienced30 in such maneuvres they did not permit themselves even to suspect that the turpitude of private swindlers might mingle itself unobserved  give its own hue to the communications31 of the French government of whose participation there was neither proof nor probability it served however for a time the purpose intended the people in many places gave a loose to the expressions of their warm indignation  of their honest preference of war to dishonour the fever was long  succesfully kept up and in the mean time war measures as ardently croudedstill however as it was known that your collegues were coming away  yourself to stay though disclaiming a separate power to conclude a treaty it was hoped by the lovers of peace that32 a project of treaty would have been prepared ad referendum33 on principles which would have satisfied our citizens  overawed any bias of the government towards a different policy but the expedition of the Sophia and as was supposed the suggestions of the person charged with your dispatches  his probable misrepresentations34 of the real wishes of the American people prevented these hopes they had then only to look forward to your return for such information either through the Executive or from yourself as might present35 to our view the other side of the medal the dispatches of Oct 22 97 had presented one face that information to a certain degree is now recieved  the public will see from your correspondence with Taleyrand that France as you testify was sincere  anxious to obtain a reconciliation not wishing us to break the British treaty but only to give her equivalent stipulations and in general was disposed to a liberal treaty36 and they will judge whether mr Pickerings report shews37 an inflexible determination to believe no declarations the French government can make nor any opinion which you judging on the spot  from actual view can give of their sincerity and to meet their designs of peace with operations of war the alien  sedition acts have already operated in the South as powerful sedatives of the XYZ inflammation in your quarter where violations of principle are either less regarded or more concealed the direct tax is likely to have the same effect  to excite enquiries into the object of the enormous expences  taxes we are bringing on and your information supervening that we might have a liberal accomodation if we would there can be little doubt of the reproduction of that general movement which had been changed for a moment by the dispatches of Oct 22 and tho small checks  stops like Logans pretended embassy may be thrown in the way from time to time  may a little retard its motion yet the tide is already turned and will sweep before it all38 the feeble obstacles of art the unquestionable republicanism of the American mind will break through the mist under which it has been clouded and will oblige its agents to reform the principles  practices of their administration39You suppose that you have been abused by both parties as far as has come to my knowledge you are misinformed I have never seen or heard a sentence of blame uttered against you by the republicans unless we were so to construe their wishes that you had more boldly cooperated in a project of a treaty and would more explicitly state whether there was in your collegues that flexibility which persons earnest after peace would have practised whether on the contrary their demeanor was not cold reserved and distant at least if not backward and whether if they had yielded to those informal conferences which Taleyrand seems to have courted the liberal accomodation you suppose might not have been effected even with their agency your fellow citizens think they have a right to full information in a case of such great concernment to them it is their sweat which is to earn all the expences of the war and their blood which is to flow in expiation of the causes of it it may be in your power to save them from these miseries by full communications and unrestrained details40 postponing motives of delicacy to those of duty it rests with you to come forward independantly to take your stand on the high ground of your own character to disregard calumny and to be borne above it on the shoulders of your grateful fellow citizens or to sink into the humble oblivion to which the Federalists selfcalled41 have secretly condemned you and even to be happy if they will indulge you with oblivion while they have beamed on your collegues meridian splendor42 pardon me my dear Sir if my expressions are strong my feelings are so much more so that it is with difficulty I reduce them even to the tone I use if you doubt the dispositions towards you look into the papers on both sides for the toasts which were given through all the states on the 4th of July you will there see whose hearts were with you and whose were ulcerated against you indeed as soon as it was known that you had consented to stay in Paris there was no measure observed in the execrations of the warparty they openly wished you might be guillotined or sent to Cayenne or any thing else and these expressions were finally stifled43 from a principle of policy only  to prevent you from being urged to a justification of yourself from this principle alone proceeds the silence  cold respect they observe towards you still they cannot prevent at times the flames bursting from under the embers as mr Pickerings letters report  conversations testify as well as the indecent expressions respecting you indulged by some of them in the debate on these dispatches these sufficiently shew that you are never more to be honoured or trusted by them  that they wait to crush you for ever only till they can do it without danger to themselves44When I sat down to answer your letter but two courses presented themselves either to say nothing or every thing for halfconfidences are not in my character I could not hesitate which was due to you I have unbosomed myself fully  it will certainly be highly gratifying if I recieve a like confidence from you for even if we differ in principle more than I believe we do you  I know too well the texture of the human mind  the slipperiness of human reason to consider differences of opinion otherwise than differences of form or feature integrity of views more than their soundness is the basis of esteem I shall follow your direction in conveying this by a private hand tho I know not as yet when one worthy of confidence will occur45  my trust in you leaves me without a

1504,1011,"""Oct 10 2022  For Tara Lagu MD the realization that the health care system was broken for patients with disabilities came when a woman shed been treating seemed to keep ignoring Lagus request that she see a urologist When Lagu asked the patients two attentive daughters about the delay their response surprised her The women said they couldnt find a urologist who was willing to see a patient in a wheelchair Surprised and a bit doubtful Lagu checked around She found that indeed the only way to get her patient in to see the kind of doctor she needed was to send her by ambulance It opened my eyes to how hard it is for patients with disabilities to navigate the health care system Lagu says Lagu director of the Center for Health Services and Outcomes Research at Northwestern University in Chicago decided to take a deeper look at how her colleagues in medicine care for  or not as the case proved  the roughly one in four American adults and millions of children with disabilities In a series of three focus groups she and her colleagues identified a range of obstacles  including some doctors attitudes  that prevent people with disabilities from getting adequate care For the study published today in the journal Health Affairs the researchers interviewed 22 doctors in three groups nonrural primary care doctors rural primary care doctors and specialists from rheumatology neurology obstetricsgynecology orthopedics and ophthalmology In the interviews conducted in fall 2018 the participants were asked about providing care for five specific types of disabilities mobility hearing vision mental health and intellectual limitations Some doctors admitted that limited resources and training left them without the space and necessary knowledge to properly care for patients with disabilities They felt they lacked the expertise or exposure to care for individuals with disabilities nor did they have enough time and space to properly accommodate these patients according to the researchers Some said they struggled to coordinate care for individuals with disabilities and did not know which kinds of accessible equipment like adjustable tables and chair scales were needed or how to use themSeveral physicians also noted that they are inadequately reimbursed for the special accommodations  including additional staff equipment and time  required to care for these patients One primary care doctor said he hired a signlanguage interpreter for a patient but the bill for their services exceeded the amount insurance reimbursed As a result he said he spent 30 of his own money per visit to see the patient Because of these limitations some doctors in the focus groups said they try to turn away patients with disabilities Both specialists and general practitioners said they had told patients with disabilities that they didnt feel they could provide the care needed and suggested they look elsewhere A few were surprisingly  even upsettingly  honest Lagu says making statements like I am not the doctor for you Previous work has shown that people with disabilities have worse health outcomes like undetected cancer obesity and cardiovascular disease But the disability itself isnt what leads to the worse outcomes says Allison Kessler MD section chief of the Rene Crown Center for Spinal Cord Innovation and associate director of the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab at Northwestern This study does a good job at highlighting the need for change on multiple levels said Kessler who was not a member of the study team People with disabilities have all these disparities in access and outcomes Weve never understood why I think the why is complicated Lagu says I think this study suggests some of the negative outcomes are due to explicit bias Its also clear that the current framework of health care in the United States does not lend to allowing physicians and medical providers the time needed to adequately address patient issues  those with disabilities or just multiple complex problems says Colin OReilly MD vice president and chief medical officer at Childrens Specialized Hospital a rehabilitation facility in New Brunswick NJ We really need a rewrite However OReilly says such a small study population with no control group and no mention of doctor resources makes it difficult to come to a strong conclusion about doctor bias and discriminatory attitudes against individuals with disabilitiesLagu agrees saying this research is not conclusive in any way The excuses doctors use to discharge patients with disabilities like we dont accept your insurance we arent taking new patients and we cant provide you with the appropriate care could be legitimate the study authors wrote in the paper But the disparities in care for people with disabilities suggest that there is a pattern of more frequently denying care to them than people without a disability they add Kessler says many of her patients have told her that they experience barriers to care Some say finding an office with the necessary equipment is a challenge or that they often dont feel welcome All the experts agree the study adds valuable insight into an ongoing health disparity And while system and policy changes are required Kessler says individual doctors can take steps to improve the situation A doctor in an academic setting can look at the curriculum and their medical school and see about increasing exposure to patients with disabilities earlier in training In a practice doctors can retrain staff to ask every patient if an accommodation is needed Each one of those changes can only help us move our system in the right direction Kessler says""",WebMD,real,0,1504

cancer that has spread to a limited number of lymph nodes and whose recurrence risk is relatively low do not benefit from chemotherapy when it is added to hormone therapy according to initial results from a clinical trial presented at the 2020 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium These findings may save tens of thousands of postmenopausal women each year the time money and harmful side effects that come with chemotherapy infusionsThis is the first evidence in a randomized phase III trial that postmenopausal women with HRpositive HER2negative breast cancer that has spread to one to three lymph nodes can safely forgo chemotherapy if their recurrence score on a genomic tumor tissue test is 25 or less The trial also demonstrated after a median of five years of followup that premenopausal women with the same disease characteristics benefited from chemotherapyThe study SWOG S1007 known as RxPONDER was supported by the National Cancer Institute NCI part of the National Institutes of Health designed and led by SWOG Cancer Research Network and conducted by the NCI National Clinical Trials Network RxPONDER was an international effort conducted at 632 sites in nine countries  the United

results are practicechanging and demonstrate that postmenopausal women can be spared unnecessary chemotherapy and receive only hormone therapy This should bring more clarity to physicians and some relief for patientsRxPONDER follows the groundbreaking TAILORx study which was also supported by NCI TAILORx showed that postmenopausal women with lymph nodenegative HRpositive HER2negative breast cancer and recurrence scores of 25 or less on a genomic tumor tissue test saw no benefit from the addition of chemotherapy to hormone therapy compared with hormone therapy alone These results however left open the question of the most effective way to treat women diagnosed with more advanced breast cancer that has spread to the lymph nodesAnalyses of data from stored tumor samples of patients in an earlier SWOG clinical trial S8814 had suggested that recurrence scores from patients with lymph nodepositive breast cancer that is HR positive and HER2 negative could potentially predict chemotherapy benefit The study team set out to find out if this was true using a molecular test called the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score This test also used in TAILORx assesses the activity of 21 genes to generate a score that indicates the risk of recurrence Scores range from 0 to 100 with 25 and below rated in the low or intermediate risk rangeThe RxPONDER team screened 9383 women with HRpositive HER2negative breast cancer and one to three positive lymph nodes to identify those with recurrence scores of 25 or less A total of 5083 such patients were randomly assigned to receive hormone therapy alone or hormone therapy plus several months of intravenous chemotherapy with taxane andor anthracyclines chemotherapy drugs that are considered standard treatment for this type of cancer Twothirds of the women in the trial were postmenopausal and data from 5015 eligible randomized patients were used in the current analysisAll women were monitored for a median of five years to

clear enough for the committee to recommend that findings be reported publicly before the final results were complete When NCI received the committees recommendation they agreedThe researchers were surprised to find that in the study population overall there was no association between recurrence score and chemotherapy benefit In other words patients with a higher recurrence score did not have a greater benefit from chemotherapy than those with a lower score However there was an association with menopausal status Postmenopausal women saw no benefit from chemotherapy regardless of recurrence score Among postmenopausal women the fiveyear IDFS rate was 916 for the chemotherapy plus hormone therapy group and 919 for the hormone therapyonly groupBy contrast among premenopausal women the study found a statistically significant benefit from chemotherapy in IDFS The fiveyear IDFS rate in premenopausal women was 942 for the chemotherapy and hormone therapy group compared with 890 for the hormone therapyonly group This benefit was seen regardless of recurrence score Premenopausal women also appeared to experience an overall survival benefit in these early results At five years the overall survival rate was 986 for those receiving chemotherapy plus hormone therapy and 973 for women in the hormone therapyonly groupThis study represents an important step toward the goal of matching patients with the most appropriate therapies and ensuring that patients do not receive treatments that are unlikely to benefit them said Larissa Korde MD MPH head of Breast Cancer and Melanoma Therapeutics in NCIs Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program These findings and additional results from this clinical trial can be expected to help improve the care of many women with a common form of breast cancerRxPONDER will follow patients for 15 years so additional data and insights are to come One unknown is why premenopausal women in the study benefited from chemotherapy while postmenopausal women did not One possible explanation is that chemotherapy can induce menopause starving the cancer of the hormones it needs to grow Additional research is needed to explore whether treatment with medications that induce menopause given in combination with standard hormone therapy would have the same effect on risk of recurrence as that seen with chemotherapy in this

coterie of bizarre series on the channel the show lurches from one surreal sometimes violent sketch to the next and describes itself as being set in an almost presentday postapocalyptic nightmare world But Million Dollar Extreme which premiered in August is also from the mind of Sam Hyde an unapologetic member of the altright Hyde crafts his comedy with the goal of shocking his young liberal Millennial audience while simultaneously appealing to likeminded members of a whitenationalist movement that generally supports Donald TrumpPerhaps unsurprisingly Million Dollar Extreme has become a cultural battleground for its network since it launched Though the show is currently off the air and awaiting a secondseason renewal some of Adult Swims other stars are demanding the shows cancellation Others are drawing attention to the networks generally poor record on diversity particularly with regards to promoting female comedians Though the controversy over Million Dollar Extreme had been roiling before Trumps Election Day victory in its aftermath the debate has become even more charged in the last week Put simply Watching Million Dollar Extreme sometimes feels like peering inside the mind of a farright Twitter troll as does looking at Hydes own feed The question for Adult Swim is whether thats enough to justify the shows cancellationBuzzfeeds Joseph Bernstein has reported on Million Dollar Extreme since it premiered Bernstein drew attention to some of Hydes worst Twitter behavior calling Lena Dunham a fat pig mocking Black Lives Matter and predicting the impending death of Hillary Clinton and pointed out the TV shows popularity with extreme altright communities like My Posting Career Hydes past as a comedian includes an anticomedic set where he read homophobic pseudoscience to a Williamsburg crowd and called them faggots then posted a video delighting in their horrified reactionsAnticomedy is intrinsic to Adult Swims brandthat is humor that seems to make a deliberate effort to not provoke laughs to make its audience uncomfortable and to challenge them with horrifying imagery and themes Some of the networks biggest hits like Aqua Teen Hunger Force The Eric Andre Show and Tim and Eric Awesome Show Great Job are masterpieces of anticomedy Million Dollar Extreme borrows tropes from each of themits abrasive crammed with strange graphics and intertitles and its sketches careen from one weird theme to the next Theres a political edge to much of the show but its meaning is often intentionally oblique Beyond that of course the whole enterprise seems cloaked in irony which makes it easier for Hyde to dismiss any obvious connection to the white supremacy and extreme nationalism of the altright When Buzzfeed asked about his altright connections Hyde replied Is that some sort of indie bookstoreStill there are plenty of sketches in Million Dollar Extreme that seem to exist only to shock and offend In one a man trips a woman and sends her flying headfirst into a glass table covering her face in blood simply because he deems her too unattractive to marry his brother In another Hyde appears in blackface screaming at a woman in exaggerated vernacular In another kids and puppets perform a song called Jews Rock while executives watch bored from behind the stage Its easy to criticize comedy in isolation and plenty of comedians from all over the political spectrum have faced ad hominem attacks where the media takes their jokes out of context But Million Dollar Extreme seems crafted with intent According to Bernstein Adult Swims standards department have repeatedly found coded racial messages including swastikas in the show that they then removed Theres also a groundswell of pushback within the network urging the executive Mike Lazzo to cancel the showThe longer the show stays on Adult Swim the more toxic its presence will be to other creators and comediansBrett Gelman a brilliant and abrasive comic who has done work with Adult Swim in the past announced this week that he was cutting ties with the network In a series of tweets he said that he was leaving out of disgust with Million Dollar Extreme as well as the networks poor record of working with women all 47 listed creators on the networks new and returning shows this summer were men Tim Heidecker the enormously influential comedian behind Adult Swim classics like Tom Goes to the Mayor and Tim and Eric has voiced his support for Gelmans decisionThe networks official statement on the matter has remained consistentevery time Buzzfeed has questioned them about Million Dollar Extreme the response has been the same Adult Swims reputation and success with its audience has always been based on strong and unique comedic voices Million Dollar Extremes comedy is known for being provocative with commentary on societal tropes and though not a show for everyone the company serves a multitude of audiences and supports the mission that is specific to Adult Swim and its fansAccording to Bernstein Lazzo is iconoclastic enough not to care about the public pressure Million Dollar Extreme is a relative hit for the network drawing more than a million viewers in its latenight slot and along with its passionate online fandom perhaps that will be enough to keep it around Still this is a show where altright Reddit groups debate the coded references to the former Ku Klux Klan Imperial Wizard David Duke that they notice in the show The longer it stays on the network the more toxic its presence will be to other creators and comediansand the more the show will seem like a strange bellwether for the current moment in culture where extremism looks to force its way into the mainstream Million Dollar Extreme will never be a widely watched

often fatal illness that can cause fever headache muscle pain weakness fatigue diarrhea vomiting stomach pain and hemorrhage severe bleeding It was first discovered in humans in 1976 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo DRC and has caused periodic cases and outbreaks in several African countries since then The largest outbreak which occurred in West Africa from 2014 to 2016 caused more than 28600 infections and more than 11300 deaths according to the World Health Organization In May 2018 the DRC reported an Ebola outbreak located in quateur Province in the northwest of the country As of May 20 health officials have reported 51 probable or confirmed cases and 27 deaths There are currently no licensed treatments available for Ebola virus disease although multiple experimental therapies are being developedWe hope this trial will establish the safety of this experimental treatment for Ebola virus disease  an important first step in a larger evaluation process said NIAID Director

collaboration with researchers from the National Institute of Biomedical Research INRB in the DRC and the Institute for Biomedical Research in Switzerland discovered that the survivor retained antibodies against Ebola 11 years after infection They isolated the antibodies and tested the most favorable ones in the laboratory and nonhuman primate studies and selected mAb114 as the most promising Professor JeanJacques Muyembe director general of INRB and one of the scientists involved in the original detection of the Ebola virus in 1976 played a key role in discovering mAb114In collaboration with the VRC scientists at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College Hanover New Hampshire illustrated that the monoclonal antibody binds to the hardtoreach core of the Ebola virus surface protein and blocks the proteins interaction with its receptor on human cells A single dose of mAb114 protected nonhuman primates days after lethal Ebola virus infection The antibody was developed in partnership with the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency It was manufactured for clinical studies by the company MedImmune based in Gaithersburg MarylandThe discovery and development of this experimental Ebola treatment was a collaborative process made possible by Ebola survivors and the DRC scientists who first

1031,1393,"""Natural history investigation will deploy latest advances to identify biomarkers targets for early therapyA new clinical study led by the National Eye Institute NEI part of the National Institutes of Health will follow 500 people over five years to learn more about the natural history of early agerelated macular degeneration AMD By using the latest technologies to visualize structures within the eye and measure their function researchers hope to identify biomarkers of disease progression well before it advances to latestage disease and causes vision loss AMD is the leading cause of vision impairment and blindness among people age 50 and older in the United StatesThe findings will contribute to our understanding of the underlying biology driving the transition from early to latestage disease so that therapies can be developed to halt its progression said the studys lead investigator Emily Y Chew MD deputy clinical director at NEI and director of the NEI Division of Epidemiology and Clinical Applications Treatments that halt the disease at its early stage would have an enormous public health impactPeople with early AMD typically do not have daylight vision loss As it progresses AMD causes cells to die in the retina the lightsensitive tissue at the back of the eye Much of the damage occurs in the macula an area of the retina responsible for sharp central visionOnly about 10 to 20 percent of people with early AMD progress to latestage disease within five years It is difficult to predict who will progress because AMD is a complex multifactorial disease influenced by a combination of age family history genetic and health behavioral factors A diet rich in green leafy vegetables and fish for example may reduce the risk while smoking cigarettes increases itWe want to better leverage advances in genetics imaging and visual functioning tests so we can look at early stage disease with more granularity There may be surrogate markers of an individuals risk of developing latestage disease long before the disease progresses Dr Chew saidThe AMD Ryan Initiative Study ARIS will track the eye health of 200 people who have bilateral early AMD defined by the presence of mediumsize drusen yellowish deposits that accumulate under the retina In addition ARIS will include 200 people with early reticular pseudodrusen a type of lesion that causes the retina to have a giraffelike macular pattern The composition and location of the reticular pseudodrusen differ from that of typical drusen Some data suggest reticular pseudodrusen are associated with a higher than usual risk for progression to late disease but more research is needed about this group For comparison the study will enroll 100 agematched drusenfree control participantsAll participants will undergo routine spectral domain optical coherence tomography SDOCT a type of imaging that shows highresolution crosssectional views of the retina SDOCT is sensitive enough to detect even small changes in the volume of drusen over timeIn addition visual function will be measured by darkadapted fundus perimetry a test that measures the sensitivity of light perception in specific parts of the retina after a persons eyes have adapted to the dark Another visual function test dark adaption is useful for evaluating night vision impairment Darkadaptation studies are relevant because AMD tends to first damage rod photoreceptors the retinal cells that allow for vision under dim conditions earlier than it does cone photoreceptors which enable daylight visionResearchers at each of the 20 ARIS study sites will track drusen volume changes as well as other findings on SDOCT to see if they correspond to functional changes in visual acuity and dark adaptationIdeally the investigators would like to complement their studies by analyzing the participants DNA to look for correlations between genes and AMD progression In total scientists have so far identified 52 independent genetic variants associated with AMD Further research is needed to determine if and how these variants influence the development and progression of the diseaseThe clinical study is funded by NEI with study sites located throughout the United States the United Kingdom Australia Germany and ItalyThe study is named after the late Stephen J Ryan MD a widely recognized expert in retinal

963,1216,"""Scientists stunted the puberty of male worms by starving them before they underwent sexual maturation In a study funded by the National Institutes of Health the scientists suggested that stress from starvation even days before sexual maturation prevented normal changes in the wiring patterns of key neuronal circuits which caused adult male worms to act immatureWe found that environmental stress can permanently and profoundly impact the connectivity of a developing nervous system said Oliver Hobert PhD professor of biological sciences at Columbia University in New York City and a senior author of the study published in NatureDr Hoberts lab studies the nervous system of tiny seethrough worms called Caenorhabditis elegans or C elegans Previously scientists in his lab showed how sexual maturation genetically reprograms and reshapes the wiring patterns of some neuronal circuits in male worms making them different from their hermaphrodite mating partnersIn this study Emily Bayer a graduate student in the lab discovered that exposure to stress specifically starvation before maturation can interrupt the rewiring program in males leaving the adult worms with immature circuits Her results also suggested that these responses to stress were in part controlled by serotonin a neurotransmitter associated with depression in humansExploring how genes and the environment shape the nervous system is critical to understanding how circuits break down to cause a variety of neurological disorders said Jill Morris PhD program director at the NIHs National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDSInitially Bayer stressed out immature worms when she accidentally left some animals unattended for a few weeks This caused the worms to pause their normal growth and enter what scientists call a dauer stateBasically if immature worms sense stress of any kind they can temporarily halt their normal growth for months and then restart it when the stress passes This temporary freeze in the growth process is the dauer state said Dr HobertEventually Bayer returned the worms to their normal environment and let them grow into adults After examining the nervous systems of stressed worms she noticed something unusual Normally some of the neuronal connections in the males tails are eliminated or pruned during sexual maturation Instead she found that immature connections in the stressed worms remained Followup experiments suggested that this was strictly caused by starvation and no other forms of stress  such as heat  could have caused the dauer stateI was totally surprised In fact I never thought stressing the worms out would matter said Bayer It wasnt until I saw differences in their circuits that I realized that stress could remap their wiring diagramsShe also found that starvation before sexual maturation caused male adult worms to act immaturely during behaviors known to be controlled by these circuits Unlike normal adult males the stressed worms were highly sensitive to a noxious chemical called SDS Stressed worms swam away from SDS while normal males barely responded The stressed worms also had problems mating Specifically they spent much less time in contact with hermaphrodite worms than normal malesFurther experiments suggested that pruning of the circuits was controlled by opposing effects of serotonin and octopamine a chemical cousin of the human fight or flight neurotransmitter norepinephrine Starved worms made abnormally high amounts of octopamine which blocked production of serotonin Exposing immature males to serotonin during starvation caused normal pruning and the adults to have mature reactions to SDS In contrast adding octopamine to an immature male worms diet prevented circuit pruningDo these results suggest that stress can disrupt the changes the human nervous system undergoes during early developmentThats a tricky question Right now its very hard to pin down these kinds of differences in humans and other animals with large complicated nervous systems said Dr Hobert Nevertheless worms are so simple and easy to study that we can provide detailed proofs of principals that may guide nervous systems great and smallCurrently his lab is part of a nationwide project called CeNGEN to map the genetic activity of every neuron in the C elegans nervous system Results from this project may help

imageforming vision or carrying out a nonvision function such as regulating pupil size or sleepwake cycles according to a new mouse study from the National Eye Institute NEI and the National Institute of Mental Health NIMH The findings could have implications for understanding how our eyes help regulate mood digestion sleep and metabolism NEI and NIMH are part of the National Institutes of HealthWe know a lot about pathways involved in imageforming vision but until now it remained unknown if and how nonimageforming visual behaviors rely on these same pathways in the eye said Johan Pahlberg PhD head of the Photoreceptor Physiology Group at NEI and a senior author of the studyVision begins when light travels into the eye and hits the retinas lightsensing photoreceptors The photoreceptors transfer signals through several layers of retinal neuron before those signals are sent to the brain Light also triggers certain nonvision functions such as controlling how much light enters the eye through the pupil pupillary light reflex and regulating the wakesleep cycle circadian rhythm Circadian rhythm disruption has been linked to sleep problems obesity and other health issuesTo investigate pathways used by imageforming versus nonimageforming functions in the retina Pahlberg and colleagues studied groups of mice that had been genetically modified to turn off one or more pathway links or synapses between photoreceptors and their next downstream neuronal neighbors called bipolar cells The group investigated the roles of rod photoreceptors which are sensitive to low light levels cone photoreceptors which see color as well as three types of bipolar cells rod bipolar cells on cone bipolar cells and off cone bipolar cellsOn cone bipolar cells react to increases in light and off cone bipolar cells react to decreases in light Cone photoreceptors can only communicate with cone bipolar cells while rod photoreceptors have pathways to communicate with each of the bipolar cell types depending on the level of light Bipolar cells then communicate with other neurons in the retina passing information to the optic nerve and on to the brain Some mice in the study had no functional connections between rods and on bipolar cells for example or connections between cones and any bipolar cells or lacked connections between rod and cone photoreceptorsThe researchers compared the mices responses to visual stimuli while assessing pupillary light responses and monitoring their nocturnal wakesleep cycle They determined that while imageforming vision can use rod and cone photoreceptors as well as all the types of bipolar cells the same was not true for nonimage forming functions The pupil response relies exclusively on rod photoreceptors while cones are unable to control this behavior Meanwhile both circadian rhythm regulation and the pupil reflex only use on bipolar cells pathways relying on rod bipolar cells and on cone bipolar cells but not off cone bipolar cellsWe were really surprised to find that animals with only off bipolar cells cant adjust to changes in the daynight cycle but can still see and respond to visual events meaning they have functional imageforming vision It was really interesting to us that the nonimaging forming functions completely ignore information from the off pathway said Pahlberg We were equally surprised that rod photoreceptors which are optimized for low light conditions were still being used for the pupillary response even when light levels were high We really thought the rods would be maxed out at that pointPahlberg expects many of these findings in mice will hold true for humans since the retinal circuitry is similar across mammals Moving forward he intends to explore other nonimageforming functions of the retina like mood regulation and see how else these different retinal circuits are being usedThe research was funded by the intramural programs of NEI NIMH the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial

602,320,"""More than 140000 US children lost a primary or secondary caregiver due to the COVID19 pandemicNew study highlights stark disparities in caregiver deaths by race and ethnicity calls for urgent public health responseOne US child loses a parent or caregiver for every four COVID19 deaths a new modeling study published today in Pediatrics reveals The findings illustrate orphanhood as a hidden and ongoing secondary tragedy caused by the COVID19 pandemic and emphasizes that identifying and caring for these children throughout their development is a necessary and urgent part of the pandemic response  both for as long as the pandemic continues as well as in the postpandemic eraFrom April 1 2020 through June 30 2021 data suggest that more than 140000 children under age 18 in the United States lost a parent custodial grandparent or grandparent caregiver who provided the childs home and basic needs including love security and daily care Overall the study shows that approximately 1 out of 500 children in the United States has experienced COVID19associated orphanhood or death of a grandparent caregiver There were racial ethnic and geographic disparities in COVID19associated death of caregivers children of racial and ethnic minorities accounted for 65 of those who lost a primary caregiver due to the pandemicChildrens lives are permanently changed by the loss of a mother father or grandparent who provided their homes basic needs and care Loss of a parent is among the adverse childhood experiences ACEs linked to mental health problems shorter schooling lower selfesteem sexual risk behaviors and increased risk of substance abuse suicide violence sexual abuse and exploitationChildren facing orphanhood as a result of COVID is a hidden global pandemic that has sadly not spared the United States said Susan Hillis CDC researcher and lead author of the study All of us  especially our children  will feel the serious immediate and longterm impact of this problem for generations to come Addressing the loss that these children have experienced  and continue to experience  must be one of our top priorities and it must be woven into all aspects of our emergency response both now and in the postpandemic futureThe study was a collaboration between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC Imperial College London Harvard University Oxford University and the University of Cape Town South Africa Published in the Oct 7 issue of the journal Pediatrics it was jointly led by CDCs COVID Response and Imperial College London and partly funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse NIDA part of the National Institutes of Health NIH as well as Imperial College LondonThe magnitude of young people affected is a sobering reminder of the devastating impact of the past 18 months said Dr Alexandra Blenkinsop colead researcher Imperial College London These findings really highlight those children who have been left most vulnerable by the pandemic and where additional resources should be directedThe analysis used mortality fertility and census data to estimate COVID19associated orphanhood death of one or both parents and deaths of custodial and coresiding grandparents between April 1 2020 and June 30 2021 for the US broadly and for every state COVID19associated deaths refers to the combination of deaths caused directly by COVID19 and those caused indirectly by associated causes such as lockdowns restrictions on gatherings and movement decreased access or quality of health care and of treatment for chronic diseases The data were also separated and analyzed by race and ethnicity including White Black Asian and American IndianAlaska Native populations and Hispanic and nonHispanic populationsThe study authors estimate that 120630 children in the US lost a primary caregiver a parent or grandparent responsible for providing housing basic needs and care due to COVID19associated death In addition 22007 children experienced the death of a secondary caregiver grandparents providing housing but not most basic needs Overall 142637 children are estimated to have experienced the death of at least one parent or a custodial or other coresiding grandparent caregiverThe death of a parental figure is an enormous loss that can reshape a childs life We must work to ensure that all children have access to evidencebased prevention interventions that can help them navigate this trauma to support their future mental health and wellbeing said NIDA Director Nora D Volkow MD At the same time we must address the many underlying inequities and health disparities that put people of color at greater risk of getting COVID19 and dying from COVID19 which puts children of color at a greater risk of losing a parent or caregiver and related adverse effects on their developmentThere were significant racial and ethnic disparities in caregiver deaths due to COVID19 White people represent 61 of the total US population and people of racial and ethnic minorities represent 39 of the total population Yet study results indicate that nonHispanic White children account for 35 of those who lost a primary caregiver 51381 children while children of racial and ethnic minorities account for 65 of those who lost a primary caregiver 91256 childrenWhen looking at both primary and secondary caregivers the study found that findings varied greatly by raceethnicity 1 of every 168 American IndianAlaska Native children 1 of every 310 Black children 1 of every 412 Hispanic children 1 of every 612 Asian children and 1 of every 753 White children experienced orphanhood or death of caregivers Compared to white children American IndianAlaska Native children were 45 times more likely to lose a parent or grandparent caregiver Black children were 24 times more likely and Hispanic children were nearly 2 times 18 more likelyOverall the states with large populations  California Texas and New York  had the highest number of children facing COVID19 associated death of primary caregivers However when analyzed by geography and raceethnicity the authors were able to map how these deaths and disparities varied at the state levelIn southern states along the USMexico border including New Mexico Texas and California between 49 and 67 of children who lost a primary caregiver were of Hispanic ethnicity In the southeast across Alabama Louisiana and Mississippi between 45 to 57 of children who lost a primary caregiver were Black And American IndianAlaska Native children who lost a primary caregiver were more frequently represented in South Dakota 55 New Mexico 39 Montana 38 Oklahoma 23 and Arizona 18The current study follows closely in line with a similar study published in The Lancet in July 2021 which found more than 15 million children around the world lost a primary or secondary caregiver during the first 14 months of the COVID19 pandemic In both the global and US studies researchers used the UNICEF definition of orphanhood as including the death of one or both parents6 The definition includes children losing one parent because they have increased risks of mental health problems abuse unstable housing and household poverty For children raised by single parents the COVID19associated death of that parent may represent loss of the person primarily responsible for providing love security and daily careWe often think of the impact of COVID19 in terms of the number of lives claimed by the disease but as this study shows it is critical to also address the broader impact  both in terms of those who have died and those who have been left behind said study coauthor Charles A Nelson III PhD who studies the effects of adversity on brain and behavioral development at Boston Childrens Hospital We must ensure children who have lost a parent or caregiver have access to the support services they need and that this additional impact of the COVID19 pandemic is comprehensively addressed in both our rapid response and our overall public health responseThere are evidencebased responses that can improve outcomes for children who experience the COVIDassociated death of their caregivers Maintaining children in their families is a priority This means families bereaved by the pandemic must be supported and those needing kinship or foster care must rapidly receive services Child resilience can be bolstered via programs and policies that promote stable nurturing relationships and address childhood adversity Key strategies include All strategies must be age specific for children and must be sensitive to racial disparities and structural inequalities They must reach the children who need them mostIn the closing words of the paper Effective action to reduce health

in adults at high risk according to results from a study funded by National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases NIDDK part of the National Institutes of Health The Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes D2d study enrolled 2423 adults and was conducted at 22 sites across the United States These findings were published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the 79th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association in San FranciscoD2d is the largest study to directly examine if daily vitamin D supplementation increases the risk of type 2 diabetes The study included adults aged 30 or older and assigned participants randomly to either take 4000 International Units IU of the D3 cholecalciferol form of vitamin D or a placebo pill daily All study participants had their vitamin D levels measured at the start of the study At that time about 80 of participants had vitamin D levels considered sufficient by US nutritional standardsObservational studies have reported an association between low levels of vitamin D and increased risk for type 2 diabetes said Myrlene Staten MD D2d project scientist at NIDDK Additionally smaller studies found that vitamin D could improve the function of beta cells which produce insulin However our study shows that vitamin D supplementation can actually increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetesThe study screened participants every three to six months for an average of 25 years to determine if diabetes had developed Researchers then compared the number of people in each of the two study groups that had progressed to type 2 diabetes At the end of the study 293 out of 1211 participants 242 in the vitamin D group developed diabetes compared to 323 out of 1212 267 in the placebo group  a statistically significant difference The study was designed to detect a risk reduction of 25 or moreD2d enrolled a diverse group of participants with a range of physical characteristics including sex age and body mass index as well as racial and ethnic diversity This representation helps ensure that the study findings could be widely applicable to people at high risk for developing type 2 diabetesIn addition to the studys size one of its major strengths is the diversity of its participants which enabled us to examine the effect of vitamin D across a large variety of people said lead author Anastassios G Pittas MD principal investigator from Tufts Medical Center Boston When the study ended we found a significant difference between the two groups showing that vitamin D supplementation can actually increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes regardless of age sex race or ethnicityMore than 50 of adults in the United States take nutritional supplements and use of vitamin D has increased substantially over the last 20 years Because of these trends the study also evaluated the safety of taking 4000 units of vitamin D daily  greater than the average daily recommended dose of 600800 IUs a day but within limits deemed appropriate for clinical research by the Institute of Medicine The researchers saw an increase in the number and frequency of predicted side effects such as high blood calcium levels and kidney stones when they compared the vitamin D and placebo groupsAs we learned from the NIDDKfunded Diabetes Prevention Program DPP type 2 diabetes is not a foregone conclusion even for those at high risk for the disease said NIDDK Director Griffin P Rodgers MD While we continue to search for new ways to prevent the disease we now know that vitamin D supplementation can actually increase the risk We encourage the 84 million US adults at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes to explore options like the CDCs National DPP available to

HIV are using the monthly ring at least some of the time according to an interim analysis of study data In addition the rate of HIV infection among participants in the openlabel study which has no placebo arm for comparison is half of what might be expected in the absence of the ring according to mathematical modeling that has significant limitationsThese preliminary findings from the HIV Open Label Extension HOPE study were presented today during a press conference at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections CROI in Boston and will be reported tomorrow in an oral presentation at the meetingIt would be ideal for women to have discreet HIV prevention tools that they want to use and can control by themselves said Carl W Dieffenbach PhD director of the Division of AIDS at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID part of NIH and the primary funder of the study Interim data from the HOPE openlabel extension study appear to be sending a positive signal about the desirability of the antiHIV vaginal ring in a setting more like the real world than previous trials We look forward to the final results from this study which should provide more definitive informationThe HOPE study launched in 2016 as a followon to the NIHfunded ASPIRE clinical trial ASPIRE demonstrated that a silicone ring that continuously releases the antiHIV drug dapivirine in the vagina safely reduced the risk of HIV infection by 27 percent An exploratory analysis of the Phase 3 ASPIRE study data subsequently found that the monthly ring reduced the risk of HIV infection by at least 56 percent in women who used it most or all of the time The goals of the current HOPE study are to gather data on whether and how women use the dapivirine ring knowing it is safe and moderately effective and to further examine the relationship between adherence to the ring and protection from HIV infection Final results are expected in 2019Since all HOPE study participants previously completed the ASPIRE trial without becoming HIVinfected an aspect of their behavior other than the use of the vaginal ring may be contributing to protection from the virus according to the study investigators HOPE study participants received HIV prevention counseling and services during their participation in ASPIRE which lasted for a median of one year and seven months The women continue receiving HIV prevention counseling and services in the current studyThe Phase 3b HOPE study also known as MTN025 is being implemented by the NIHfunded Microbicide Trials Network MTN at 14 former ASPIRE study sites in Malawi South Africa Uganda and Zimbabwe Because women accounted for 58 percent of new HIV infections among adults in southern and eastern Africa in 2016 protecting them from acquiring the virus is essential to controlling the HIV epidemicThe Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the National Institute of Mental Health both part of NIH cofund the MTN with NIAIDWhile ASPIRE study participants did not know until the end of the trial whether they had received the dapivirine ring or a placebo ring the HOPE study team is offering the dapivirine ring to all who enroll HOPE study participants are sexually active HIVnegative women ages 20 to 49 years who participated in ASPIRE and are not pregnant More than 1400 women had enrolled in the HOPE study as of October 2017 the data cutoff for the interim analysisThe HOPE study is being led by Jared Baeten MD PhD a professor of global health medicine and

their risk of HIV infection and this is helping them achieve a level of protection said Dr BaetenParticipants in the HOPE study are being offered the dapivirine ring to insert into their vagina for a month at a time for up to 12 consecutive months During the first three months the women attend monthly study visits where they may obtain a new ring Thereafter they attend quarterly visits where they may obtain three rings at a time a schedule that more closely resembles how the ring might be distributed in a realworld settingParticipants may remain in the HOPE study regardless of whether they accept or use new rings By allowing women to opt out of ring use but remain in the study researchers are gaining insight into whether participants like using the ring and why as well as what factors influence use and nonuse More than 90 percent of participants accepted the ring when they entered the studyAdherence to the ring is being assessed by measuring residual levels of dapivirine in returned rings and blood levels of dapivirine Some 89 percent of the rings returned as of October 2017 have residual dapivirine levels consistent with some use during the prior month In contrast 77 percent of returned rings in the ASPIRE study had residual dapivirine levels consistent with some use during the prior month suggesting that adherence in the HOPE study is roughly 16 percent higher than it was in ASPIRE Investigators lacked data to precisely quantify the duration of ring use in either study The ring is designed to be worn continuously throughout the month to provide effective protection Measurements of blood levels of dapivirine were not included in the interim analysisAs of October 2017 HOPE study participants have become infected with HIV at a rate of 19 new infections per 100 personyears of followup Personyears are the sum of the number of years that each participant has been in the studyOther forms of HIV prevention have proven to provide high levels of protection from the virus For instance oral tablets of the medication Truvada for HIV preexposure prophylaxis PrEP reduce the risk of HIV infection by up to 92 percent in people at high risk when taken daily as prescribed although taking a daily pill can be challenging for some peopleBecause the HOPE study lacks a concurrent control group receiving a placebo ring investigators used a mathematical approach to estimate what the HIV incidence would be if the women in the study had lacked access to the dapivirine ringFirst the researchers determined the characteristics of the HOPE study population based on age location and presence of a curable sexually transmitted infection when joining the study Next they identified an equal number of women from the placebo group in the ASPIRE trial who had similar characteristics and calculated the HIV incidence in that set Then the investigators repeated this mathematical sampling of the ASPIRE placebo group 10000 times In this modeling exercise the average HIV incidence was 41 new infections per 100 personyears for the ASPIRE participants receiving the placebotwice the rate found in the new interim analysis of the HOPE study population The investigators never calculated an HIV incidence as low as 19 per 100 personyears in their mathematical sampling of the ASPIRE placebo group Comparing the HOPE study population to the ASPIRE placebo group is significantly limited by the differences between the two groups however In addition the HOPE study is not powered to determine the effectiveness of the ringThe HOPE study is sponsored by the International Partnership for Microbicides IPM which developed the dapivirine vaginal ring and is providing it for the study IPM led a sister study to ASPIRE and is conducting its own openlabel

research project focusing on nondrug approaches for pain management addressing the needs of service members and veterans Twelve research projects totaling approximately 81 million over six years pending available funds will focus on developing implementing and testing costeffective largescale realworld research on nondrug approaches for pain management and related conditions in military and veteran health care delivery organizations The National Institutes of Health will be the lead HHS agency in this partnershipFinding solutions for chronic pain is of critical importance especially for military personnel and veterans who are disproportionately affected said NIH Director Francis S Collins MD PhD Bringing the science to bear through these realworld research projects will accelerate our search for pain management strategies for all Americans especially as we work to address the nations opioid crisisThese projects will provide important information about the feasibility acceptability safety and effectiveness of nondrug approaches in treating pain Types of approaches being studied include mindfulnessmeditative interventions movement interventions eg structured exercise tai chi yoga manual therapies eg spinal manipulation massage acupuncture psychological and behavioral interventions eg cognitive behavioral therapy integrative approaches that involve more than one intervention and integrated models of multimodal careThe National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health NCCIH part of NIH is contributing more than half of the total funding and it is the lead for this multiagency initiative called the NIHDoDVA Pain Management Collaboratory which is modeled on the successful NIH Health Care Systems Research Collaboratory This initiative also addresses the need to focus on advancing better practices for pain management which is outlined in HHS 5point strategy to combat the opioid crisisNCCIH has made pain research a priority  especially in military and veteran populations We first partnered with the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the VA in 2014 and are delighted to expand the partnership to include the DoD and additional HHSNIH components said Dr Josephine Briggs director of NCCIHWe are so pleased to work alongside our federal partners to develop effective ways to treat pain in our service members and veterans that do not expose them to the risks of opioids said Rachel Ramoni DMD ScD chief research and development officer for the VA This work reflects the VAs commitment to reducing opioid overuse and expanding alternative pain managementStudies report nearly 45 percent of soldiers and 50 percent of veterans experience pain on a regular basis and there is significant overlap among chronic pain posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD and persistent postconcussive symptoms Data from the National Health Interview Survey shows that American veterans experience a higher prevalence of pain and more severe pain than nonveterans Although opioids are often prescribed to treat chronic pain research has not shown them to be very effective and there are many issues with longterm use Thus there is a need for nondrug approaches to complement current strategies for pain management and to reduce the need for and hazards of excessive reliance on opioidsPain is the most common medical condition requiring treatment for military personnel Current drug treatments have limited efficacy and are often associated with severe adverse events significant cognitive and physiological side effects and pose a significant risk of abuse misuse addiction tolerance and diversion The proposals funded under this interagency partnership will provide a significant step forward in pain management in our wounded service members We are

clerical sex abuse and understandably so Activists for survivors of clerical sexual abuse have reacted furiously after Pope Francis refused to promise a zero tolerance approach to pedophile priests and the bishops who cover up their crimes as he closed a summit at the VaticanWatchBut should we really be surprised by Franciss positionThis is the Pope who takes every opportunity to declare the Bible is wrong after all He kicked off his papacy by declaring evolution and the big bang theory were realThis is the pope who informed his flock that relationships with Jesus are dangerous and harmful Breaking with centuries of Christian tradition Pope Francis sparked fears that he is an illegitimate pope with a sinister agenda when he told a crowd of 33000 pilgrims in St Peters Square in Rome that a personal direct immediate relationship with Jesus Christ must be avoided at all costsAnd as though that wasnt disturbing enough Francis followed up with the equally sinister proclamation that Jesus is SatanPope Francis is a fullypaid up member of the globalist elite And dont forget  to the elite bad is goodAs an Agenda Contributor at the World Economic Forum Pope Francis is fluent in blasphemy and is actively working to subvert the church and Christianity in generalPope Francis inverted version of Christianity is confusing for many however his agenda becomes much easier to understand when you realize who the pontiff is really serving To quote French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen Pope Francis is a globalist bulldog who is loyal to the New World OrderIn 2017 Pope Francis called for a one world government and political authority arguing that the creation of the one world government is needed to combat issues such as climate change Speaking with Ecuadors El Universo newspaper the Pope said that the United Nations does not have enough power and must be granted full governmental control for the good of humanityThis includes Americans he stressed who according to the pope must be ruled by a world government for their own goodNow Pope Francis is actively defying Biblical scripture by working to create a one world religionIn 2019 Pope Francis signed a historic covenant with leaders of the worlds major faiths pushing us much closer to a oneworld religion one of the major goals of the New World OrderAccording to the document produced by Pope Francis and published on the Vaticans official website all religions must be considered equal and Islam is as acceptable to God as ChristianityHe then shocked the Christian world by hosting Islamic prayers and Quran recitals in the VaticanChristians around the world should visit mosques and praise Allah according to Pope Francis who led by example on his visit to Istanbul by entering the Blue Mosque taking off his shoes facing Mecca and praising the Muslim godAs though he hadnt already made it clear that he is not a man of God Francis then hosted a pagan ceremony including brazen idol worship on Vatican groundsOnly time will tell if Pope Franciss depraved and corrupt vision of the future is accepted by Catholics around the world but one things for sure traditional conservative Christians are not going down without a fightAnd nor should theyThe globalist elite have issued a series of chilling warnings to the people of the world hand over your sovereignty and accept the New

studies sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID part of the National Institutes of Health NIH will test different dosages of the inactivated influenza vaccine candidate called 2017 H7N9 IIV as well as different vaccination schedules The studies also will evaluate whether an adjuvant boosts the immune responses of people receiving the vaccineH7N9 is an avian bird influenza virus first reported in humans in 2013 in China Since then six waves of H7N9 infection have occurred in China resulting in more than 1500 cumulative human infections according to the World Health Organization No human cases of H7N9 influenza have been detected to date in the United States Currently the virus does not spread easily from person to person rather people typically become infected through direct exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments However if the virus mutates and becomes easily transmissible between humans it could result in an influenza pandemic because most people have little to no immunity to it H7N9 has a high mortality rate resulting in death in 39 percent of those who became infectedAs we experience one of the worst seasonal influenza epidemics in recent years here in the United States we also must maintain a scientific focus on novel influenza viruses such as H7N9 that have the potential to cause a pandemic said NIAID Director Anthony S Fauci MD These new clinical trials will build upon initial studies of earlier versions of an H7N9 vaccine candidate to provide a more detailed picture of its safety and ability to generate a protective immune response to current H7N9 strainsThe two clinical trials will test the experimental 2017 H7N9 inactivated influenza vaccine developed by Sanofi Pasteur based in Lyon France supported by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority BARDA a component of the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response NIAID funded previous research on the earlier version of the vaccine The new version of the vaccine candidate uses an inactivated form of H7N9 influenza virus collected in 2017 to increase the likelihood that the vaccine will provide immunity against a newlyevolved strain of H7N9 which is currently circulating in the wild During these clinical trials some participants will receive an adjuvant called AS03 along with the test vaccine to confirm that the adjuvant can boost the immune response to the vaccine as previously shown for other influenza viruses of pandemic potential The adjuvant is produced by GSKs vaccines business headquartered in Wavre Belgium with support from BARDA Both clinical trials will be conducted by the NIAIDfunded network of Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units VTEUsOne clinical trial led by principal investigator Lisa A Jackson MD of the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle will test the vaccine candidate at different dosages both with and without the AS03 adjuvant The study will enroll as many as 420 male and nonpregnant female volunteers ages 19 to 64 years and up to 300 volunteers older than 65 years of age Each participant will be randomly assigned to one of five groups Three of the groups at least 480 volunteers in total will receive the adjuvanted vaccine candidate at different dosages 375 micrograms mcg 75 mcg or 15 mcg The two remaining groups at least 160 volunteers in all will receive unadjuvanted vaccine 15 mcg or 45 mcg All five groups will be vaccinated twice once at the first visit and then again 21 days later Volunteers will be monitored for seven days following each vaccination and assessed for side effects and blood samples will be tested for H7N9 antibodies Clinical staff will follow the volunteers for one year The trial is being conducted at VTEU sites in Georgia Iowa Maryland North Carolina and WashingtonThe second clinical trial will be led by Kathleen M

randomly assigned to one of three groups The first group 60 volunteers will receive the investigational H7N9 vaccine with AS03 adjuvant 05 milliliter ml dose of 375 mcg and the quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine 05 ml dose intramuscularly within 15 minutes of each other on day 1 and then another dose 375 mcg of the adjuvanted H7N9 vaccine candidate 21 days later The second group 60 volunteers will receive the seasonal influenza vaccine 05 ml dose on the first day and two doses 375 mcg of the H7N9 vaccine candidate with adjuvant on days 22 and 43 The third group 30 volunteers will serve as a comparator and will receive only the seasonal influenza vaccine on day 1 Study participants will be monitored for seven days following each vaccination to assess for side effects and blood samples will be tested for antibodies to the 2017 H7N9 virus and seasonal influenza Some volunteers will also be tested for antibodies against other variants of H7N9 to see if the vaccine candidate is likely to provide protection as the virus continues to evolve in the wild Followup for the volunteers will last up to one year after their last vaccination The study is being conducted at

990,1292,"""New approach to immunotherapy leads to complete response in breast cancer patient unresponsive to other treatmentsA novel approach to immunotherapy developed by researchers at the National Cancer Institute NCI has led to the complete regression of breast cancer in a patient who was unresponsive to all other treatments This patient received the treatment in a clinical trial led by Steven A Rosenberg MD PhD chief of the Surgery Branch at NCIs Center for Cancer Research CCR and the findings were published June 4 2018 in Nature Medicine NCI is part of the National Institutes of HealthWeve developed a highthroughput method to identify mutations present in a cancer that are recognized by the immune system Dr Rosenberg said This research is experimental right now But because this new approach to immunotherapy is dependent on mutations not on cancer type it is in a sense a blueprint we can use for the treatment of many types of cancerThe new immunotherapy approach is a modified form of adoptive cell transfer ACT ACT has been effective in treating melanoma which has high levels of somatic or acquired mutations However it has been less effective with some common epithelial cancers or cancers that start in the lining of organs that have lower levels of mutations such as stomach esophageal ovarian and breast cancersIn an ongoing phase 2 clinical trial the investigators are developing a form of ACT that uses tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes TILs that specifically target tumor cell mutations to see if they can shrink tumors in patients with these common epithelial cancers As with other forms of ACT the selected TILs are grown to large numbers in the laboratory and are then infused back into the patient who has in the meantime undergone treatment to deplete remaining lymphocytes to create a stronger immune response against the tumorA patient with metastatic breast cancer came to the trial after receiving multiple treatments including several chemotherapy and hormonal treatments that had not stopped her cancer from progressing To treat her the researchers sequenced DNA and RNA from one of her tumors as well as normal tissue to see which mutations were unique to her cancer and identified 62 different mutations in her tumor cellsThe researchers then tested different TILs from the patient to find those that recognized one or more of these mutated proteins TILs recognized four of the mutant proteins and the TILs then were expanded and infused back into the patient She was also given the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab to prevent the possible inactivation of the infused T cells by factors in the tumor microenvironment After the treatment all of this patients cancer disappeared and has not returned more than 22 months laterThis is an illustrative case report that highlights once again the power of immunotherapy said Tom Misteli PhD director of CCR at NCI If confirmed in a larger study it promises to further extend the reach of this Tcell therapy to a broader spectrum of cancersInvestigators have seen similar results using mutationtargeted TIL treatment for patients in the same trial with other epithelial cancers including liver cancer and colorectal cancer Dr Rosenberg explained that results like this in patients with solid epithelial tumors are important because ACT has not been as successful with these kinds of cancers as with other types that have more mutationsHe said the big picture here is this kind of treatment is not cancertype specific All cancers have mutations and thats what were attacking with this immunotherapy he said It is ironic that the very mutations that cause the cancer may prove to be the best targets to treat the cancerFor more on the clinical trial see

available biologic therapies for severe forms of relapsing multiple sclerosis MS The trial sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID part of the National Institutes of Health will compare the safety efficacy and costeffectiveness of the two therapeutic approachesMS is an autoimmune disease in which a persons own immune cells attack the central nervous system The experimental treatment involves using a mixture of four chemical agents to remove these immune cells Some of the persons own bloodforming stem cells which were extracted before treatment are then infused back into the individual These cells repopulate the immune system allowing it to reset itself so that the new immune cells no longer attack the central nervous system This form of treatment is called autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or AHSCTFor many people with MS  a chronic debilitating unpredictable and currently incurable disease  daily life can be a challenge said NIAID Director Anthony S Fauci MD AHSCT has the potential to halt the progress of relapsing MS eliminate the need for a person to take lifelong medication and allow the body to partially regain function However we need to be certain that the benefits of this form of treatment outweigh its serious risksIt is estimated that MS affects more than 23 million people worldwide mostly women including more than one million people in the United States Symptoms of the disease vary widely and may include motor and speech difficulties weakness fatigue and chronic pain The most common form of the disease is relapsingremitting MS which is characterized by periods of mild or no symptoms interspersed with symptom flareups or relapses Incomplete recovery from relapses often leads to increasing disability Over years the disease can worsen and shift to a progressive form that may also include relapsesThe Food and Drug Administration has approved more than a dozen drugs for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS These drugs vary in efficacy safety and cost For many people with severe forms of relapsing MS first and secondline drugs fail to adequately control the disease Previous studies have suggested that AHSCT may be an effective and durable treatment for these individuals but it has never been formally compared headtohead with the available thirdline drugs which are highly effective but can have harsh side effects AHSCT also carries the risks of serious side effects and even deathGiven these risks and benefits investigators aim to determine whether AHSCT is an appropriate treatment option for people with severe forms of relapsing MS who would otherwise receive one of the best available thirdline biologic drugsThe trial is called BEATMS BEst Available Therapy versus autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant for Multiple Sclerosis It is being conducted by the NIAIDfunded Immune Tolerance Network ITN in collaboration with the Blood and Marrow

Cohen MD a professor of neurology at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine and the director of the Experimental Therapeutics Program in the Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis Treatment and Research at the Cleveland ClinicBEATMS will enroll 156 adults ages 18 to 55 years at 19 sites in the United States and the United Kingdom Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either AHSCT or one of the best available highefficacy biologic drugs and then will be followed for 6 years The neurologists who periodically examine the participants and assess their level of disability will not know which type of treatment they were assignedThe main outcome investigators will measure is how much time elapses between a participants assignment to a treatment strategy and MS relapse or death from any cause if either of these occur during the first three years of the followup period The researchers also will examine the mechanisms of action of the two treatment strategies and will compare the newly developing immune systems of participants who receive AHSCT with the immunologic features of participants who receive the best available biologic drugs In addition investigators will compare the effects of the two treatment strategies on other measures of disease activity and severity costeffectiveness in terms of health care costs and individual productivity and participants quality of

link between hair straighteners and uterine cancer is not going to make her stop This study is not enough to cause me to say Ill stay away from this because the researchers dont prove that using relaxers causes cancer Ghazi says Indeed primary care doctors are unlikely to address the increased risk of uterine cancer in women who frequently use hair straighteners that the study reported Among frequent users of hair straighteners  meaning those who used them more than four times a year  the researchers found that women were 255 times more likely to be diagnosed with uterine cancer than those who never used these products In the recently published paper on this research the authors say that they found an 80 higher adjusted risk of uterine cancer among women who had ever straightened relaxed or used hair pressing products in the 12 months before enrolling in their study This finding is real but small says internist Douglas S Paauw MD professor of medicine at the University of Washington in Seattle Paauw is among several primary care doctors interviewed for this story who expressed little concern about the implications of this research for their patients Since we have hundreds of things we are supposed to discuss at our 20minute clinic visits this would not make the cut Paauw says While its good to be able to answer questions a patient might ask about this new research the study does not prove anything he says Alan Nelson MD an internistendocrinologist and former special advisor to the CEO of the American College of Physicians says while the study is well done the number of actual cases of uterine cancer found were small One of the reasons he would not recommend discussing the study with patients is that the brands of hair products used to straighten hair in the study were not identifiedAlexandra White PhD lead author of the study said participants were simply asked In the past 12 months how frequently have you or someone else straightened or relaxed your hair or used hair pressing products The terms straightened relaxed and hair pressing products were not defined and some women may have interpreted the term pressing products to mean nonchemical products such as flat irons says White who is also head of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Environment and Cancer Epidemiology group in an email Dermatologist Crystal Aguh MD associate professor of dermatology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine tweeted the following advice in light of the new findings The overall risk of uterine cancer is quite low so its important to remember that For now if you want to change your routine theres no downside to decreasing your frequency of hair straightening to every 12 weeks or more as that may lessen your risk She also noted that styles like relaxer silk pressing and keratin treatments should only be done by a professional as this will decrease the likelihood of hair damage and scalp irritation I also encourage women to look for hair products free of parabens and phthalates which are generically listed as fragrance on products to minimize exposure to hormone disrupting chemicals Ghazi says she decided to stop using keratin straighteners years ago after she learned they are made with several added ingredients That includes the chemical formaldehyde a known carcinogen according to the American Cancer Society People have been relaxing their hair for a very long time and I feel more comfortable using a relaxer to straighten my hair than any of the others out there Ghazi says Janaki Ram who has had her hair chemically straightened several times says the findings have not made her worried that straightening will cause her to get uterine cancer specifically but that they are a reminder that the chemicals in these products could harm her in some other way She says the new study findings her knowledge of the damage straightening causes to hair and the lengthy amount of time receiving a keratin treatment takes will lead her to reduce the frequency with which she gets her hair straightenedGoing forward I will have this done once a year instead of twice a year she says White the author of the study says in an interview that the takeaway for consumers is that women who reported frequent use of hair straightenersrelaxers and pressing products were over twice as likely to go on to develop uterine cancer compared to women who reported no use of these products in the previous year However uterine cancer is relatively rare so these increases in risks are small she says Less frequent use of these products was not as strongly associated with risk suggesting that decreasing use may be an option to reduce harmful exposure Black women were the most frequent users of these products and therefore these findings are more relevant for Black women We estimated that 164 of women who never used hair straighteners would go on to develop uterine cancer by the age of 70 but for frequent users that risk goes up to 405 White says in a statement One of the original aims of the study was to better understand the environmental and genetic causes of breast cancer but we are also interested in studying ovarian cancer uterine cancer and many other cancers and chronic diseases White says in an interview""",WebMD,real,0,1483

not to get exposed to carcinogenic dioxins Recently one hoax email has been attributed to Johns Hopkins University The Office of Communications and Public Affairs discussed the issue with Rolf Halden PhD PE assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences and the Center for Water and Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Dr Halden received his masters and doctoral degrees researching dioxin contamination in the environment We sat down with him to set the record straight on dioxins in the food supply and the risks associated with drinking water from plastic bottles and cooking with plasticsOffice of Communications and Public Affairs What are dioxinsRolf Halden Dioxins are organic environmental pollutants sometimes referred to as the most toxic compounds made by mankind They are a group of chemicals which include 75 different chlorinated molecules of dibenzopdioxin and 135 chlorinated dibenzofurans Some polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs also are referred to as dioxinlike compounds Exposure to dioxins can cause chloracne a severe form of skin disease as well as reproductive and developmental effects and more importantly liver damage and cancerOCPA Where do dioxins come fromRH We always thought dioxins were manmade compounds produced inadvertently during the bleaching of pulp and manufacturing of pesticides like Agent Orange and other chlorinated aromatics But dioxins in sediments from lakes and oceans predate these human activities It is now generally accepted that a principal source of dioxins are various combustion processes including natural events such as wild fires and even volcanic eruptionsToday the critical issue is the incineration of waste particularly the incineration of hospital waste which contains a great deal of polyvinyl chloride plastics and aromatic compounds that can serve as dioxin precursors One study examined the burning of household trash in drums in the backyard It turns out that these small burnings of debris can put out as much or more dioxins as a fullsized incinerator burning hundreds of tons of refuse per day The incinerators are equipped with stateoftheart emission controls that limit dioxin formation and their release into the environment but the backyard trash burning does not You set it ablaze and chemistry takes over What happens next is that the dioxins are sent into the atmosphere where they become attached to particles and fall back to earth Then they bind to or are taken up by fish and other animals where they get concentrated and stored in fat before eventually ending up on our lunch and dinner plates People are exposed to them mostly from eating meat and fish rich in fatOCPA What do you make of this recent email warning that claims dioxins can be released by freezing water in plastic bottlesRH No This is an urban legend There are no dioxins in plastics In addition freezing actually works against the release of chemicals Chemicals do not diffuse as readily in cold temperatures which would limit chemical release if there were dioxins in plastic and we dont think there areOCPA So its okay for people to drink out of plastic water bottlesRH First people should be more concerned about the quality of the water they are drinking rather than the container its coming from Many people do not feel comfortable drinking tap water so they buy bottled water instead The truth is that city water is much more highly regulated and monitored for quality Bottled water is not It can legally contain many things we would not tolerate in municipal drinking waterHaving said this there is another group of chemicals called phthalates that are sometimes added to plastics to make them flexible and less brittle Phthalates are environmental contaminants that can exhibit hormonelike behavior by acting as endocrine disruptors in humans and animals If you heat up plastics you could increase the leaching of phthalates from the containers into water and foodOCPA What about cooking with plasticsRH In general whenever you heat something you increase the likelihood of pulling chemicals out Chemicals can be released from plastic packaging materials like the kinds used in some microwave meals Some drinking straws say on the label not for hot beverages Most people think the warning is because someone might be burned If you put that straw into a boiling cup of hot coffee you basically have a hot water extraction going on where the chemicals in the straw are being extracted into your nice cup of coffee We use the same process in the lab to extract chemicals from materials we want to analyzeIf you are cooking with plastics or using plastic utensils the best thing to do is to follow the directions and only use plastics that are specifically meant for cooking Inert containers are best for example heatresistant glass ceramics and good old stainless steelOCPA Is there anything else you want to addRH Dont be afraid of drinking water It is very important to drink adequate amounts of water and by the way thats in addition to all the coffee beer and other diuretics we love to consume Unless you are drinking really bad water you are more likely to suffer from the adverse effects of dehydration than from the minuscule amounts of chemical contaminants present in your water supply Relatively speaking the risk from exposure to microbial contaminants is much greater than that from chemicalsAnd heres one more uncomfortable fact Each of us already carries a certain body burden of dioxins regardless of how and what we eat If you look hard enough youll find traces of dioxins in pretty much every place on earth Paracelsus the famous medieval alchemist used to put it straight and simple its the dose that makes the poisonTim

the past 2 years says Fiona Lowenstein a journalist who started the group called Body Politic that has become a COVID support group The public Facebook COVID and long COVID groups are studded with posts and comments like this among the hundreds that can come in a day On a single day in late October Survivor Corps posters were trying to find out if anyone else had hair loss rashes sleep apnea issues migraines bladder problems neck pain vertigo allergies or double vision An October post on increasing cholesterol levels drew more than 50 comments within 17 hours The support groups provide advice and encouragement that patients often are not getting from their medical providers friends and family Theyre also a source of valuable data for researchers But some doctors worry that they are not always entirely benign even as they gain popularity Patient support groups have moved out of the hospital community room and onto Facebook Reddit WhatsApp and other online spaces Before long COVID was recognized these forums were a lifeline for patients with chronic conditions After having lived with myalgic encephalomyelitischronic fatigue syndrome MECFS for years long COVID seemed familiar to JD Davids a chronic disabilities activist in Brooklyn who works with a group called Long COVID Justice He thinks patient groups are important for anyone with unexplained postinfection symptoms like extreme fatigueOne of the problems is that these oftenvolunteerbased patient support groups are all that people have Davids says The groups are essential to patients but need to be part of a comprehensive care plan he says While offering support online groups can be sources of misinformation and unproven remedies Advocates and doctors say some group members come to them asking about miracle cures and supplements Alexander Truong MD a doctor at Emory University in Atlanta who works with long COVID patients says many of his patients have bought expensive but useless vitamins and supplements they learn about online A lot of these patients are grasping at straws to try to figure out anything that can make them feel better and they are very vulnerable to this kind of scam he said during a live online forum hosted by SciLine a project of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Privacy can be another issue Tens of thousands of people post details about their health and lives in public Facebook groups Anyone signed on to Facebook can read the posts Analysis of these private patient conversations can also produce useful data for researchers The organization

paired with solid medical care and support services advocates say Davids says he is most active in the Body Politic channel on the online tool Slack where 11000 members meet privately He appreciates that a human not an algorithm chooses which posts he sees And he thinks Body Politic is well moderated something he and others suggest patients consider when joining a group Support groups should be moderated You could ask as a support group member  how are our moderators trained How do you know are they equipped to manage the space he asksThe Survivor Corps page is heavily heavily moderated Berrent says Users cannot state a scientific fact unless they link to a legitimate source she says They can talk about what has helped them but they cant give medical advice or talk politics Conflict among group members may be a source of agitation and that could be a drawback Davids cautions He suggests that patients try out a few groups and see what happens when conflicts emerge How is it handled Does it sit right with you Does it get your heart racing  which you certainly dont need he says Davids offers a list of recommended groups on his Long COVIDJustice page The Body Politic group was founded as a wellness collective before the pandemic but morphed into a long COVID group in 2020 when Lowenstein and another member got sick They say they couldnt find help anywhere else

of COVID19 infection during these six months the professor writes before providing the full datasetWhile no causeeffect conclusions could be inferred from this observational analysis the lack of negative correlations between mask usage and COVID19 cases and deaths suggest that the widespread use of masks at a time when an effective intervention was most needed ie during the strong 20202021 autumnwinter peak was not able to reduce COVID19 transmission the study concluded Moreover the moderate positive correlation between mask usage and deaths in Western Europe also suggests that the universal use of masks may have had harmful unintended consequencesThe mask studys results are similar to those of Harvardled researchers when they found that the higher a nations vaccination rates the higher the case rates The Harvard study of 68 nations and 2947 counties in the United States published in the European Journal of Epidemiology in late 2021The scientific findings were discovered by a Harvard researcher S V Subramanian of the Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies and Canadian researcher Akhil KumarAt the countrylevel there appears to be no discernable relationship between percentage of population fully vaccinated and new COVID19 cases in the last 7 days Fig 1 the study stated In fact the trend line suggests a marginally positive association such that countries with higher percentage of population fully vaccinated have higher COVID19 cases per 1 million peopleThose startling results have been further verified at the statelevel in the United States The highestvaccinated states are now among the few remaining hot spots in the countryIt should come as a surprise to no one that these hot spot states in the United States also happen to be

Covid policy responses that include quarantining masks and social distancing as well as the lockdowns have failed to produce statistically significant results fighting Covid but have wrought serious damage to the economy and violated countless Americans rightsAn exhaustive Johns Hopkins University comparative analysis published in January found that strict lockdowns failed to significantly reduce Covidrelated deathsLockdowns in the US and Europe had little or no impact in reducing deaths from COVID19 according to a new analysis by researchers at Johns Hopkins University the Washington Times reported The lockdowns during the early phase of the pandemic in 2020 reduced COVID19 mortality by about 02 said the broad review of multiple scientific studiesWe find no evidence that lockdowns school closures border closures and limiting gatherings have had a noticeable effect on COVID19 mortality the researchers wroteNow we can add mask mandates to the list of public health interventions

mAbs to treat the disease Researchers sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID part of the National Institutes of Health are working with clinical sites to identify potential patient volunteers currently infected with SARSCoV2 the virus which causes COVID19 who have mild to moderate disease not requiring hospitalization They will be invited to take an experimental therapy or a placebo as part of a rigorously designed randomized clinical trial The trial which is known as ACTIV2 also may investigate other experimental therapeutics later under the same trial protocolIf the investigational mAbs show promise the study would expand from a Phase 2 to a Phase 3 trial to gather additional critical data from a larger pool of volunteers without delay The trial will be led by the NIAIDfunded AIDS Clinical Trials Group ACTG and will enroll participants at sites around the worldACTIV2 was established as part of NIHs Accelerating COVID19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines ACTIV a publicprivate partnership program instituted to speed development of the most promising treatments and vaccines This study is also receiving support through Operation Warp Speed the US governments multiagency effort to develop manufacture and distribute medical countermeasures to fight COVID19The design of the study is adaptive to enable maximum flexibility in the shortest time frame If the experimental treatment appears effective in the first stage the treatment can be advanced rapidly to testing in larger groups of volunteers The study also can be adapted to test additional therapeuticsWe have seen encouraging rapid results from other adaptive treatment trials for COVID19 said NIH Director Francis S Collins MD PhD Under ACTIV specific therapeutics are being prioritized based on their likelihood for success Prioritized therapeutics under ACTIV will use a master protocol that emphasizes flexibility which enables these critical trials to be conducted without incurring delays when a treatment shows promiseThe first therapeutic to be tested in this trial will be LYCoV555 an investigational monoclonal antibody made by Eli Lilly and Company Indianapolis Indiana LYCoV555 emerged from Lillys collaboration with AbCellera Biologics Vancouver British Columbia Antibodies are infectionfighting proteins produced by immune cells Socalled neutralizing antibodies target specific viruses or other pathogens This antibody which was discovered by AbCellera in collaboration with NIAIDs Vaccine Research Center was isolated from a blood sample from a recovered COVID19 patient Copies of this antibody were then synthesized in a labthe term monoclonal refers to these laboratorymanufactured antibodiesUsing an antibody generated by the immune system of a recovered COVID19 patient gives us a jump start on finding a safe and effective therapeutic said NIAID Director Anthony S Fauci MD Investigating a variety of different therapeutics including monoclonal antibodies will help ensure that we advance towards an effective treatment for people suffering from COVID19 disease as quickly as possibleThe initial stage of the trial is designed to enroll approximately 220 volunteers who report recently experiencing symptoms of COVID19 and who test positive for the virus but are not hospitalized Once enrolled they will be randomly assigned to one of two groups 110 volunteers will receive an intravenous IV infusion of LYCoV555 and 110 volunteers will receive a placebo infusion of a saline solution The infusion takes approximately an hour to deliver and volunteers will be observed afterwards to note any reactionsOver the next 28 days participants will attend a series of clinic or athome visits by clinicians to track their COVID19 symptoms Investigators also will check whether RNA from SARSCoV2 can still be detected in participants noses and saliva using a standard nasopharyngeal swab Because people with COVID19 often have unusually low blood oxygen levels participants will receive pulse oximetry tests to help determine if the investigational therapeutic has a positive effect on blood oxygen levels They also will give blood samples to help researchers understand how the experimental therapeutics are functioning in their bodies as well as whether they are affecting the course of their SARSCoV2 infection Participants will receive additional followup for up to 24 weeksThe primary goals of the Phase 2 trial are to evaluate safety to see if the investigational therapeutic can reduce the duration of symptoms through study day 28 and to see if the investigational therapeutic can increase the proportion of participants with undetectable virus in nasopharyngeal swabs at specific time points If there are no serious safety concerns and if the investigational therapeutic appears to meet other specific other criteria such as sufficiently reducing the duration of symptoms or the viral load in the volunteers bodies the trial will transition to Phase 3 and enroll up to 1780 additional outpatient volunteers for a total of 2000 trial participants The primary goal of the Phase 3 study will be to determine if the investigational therapeutic can prevent either hospitalization or death through study day 28 while also continuing to evaluate its safety Participants in the Phase 3 portion of the study will not be provided nasopharyngeal swabs though they will still perform selfcollected anterior nasal swabs and they will attend fewer clinic visitsThe study team is led by

1120,1672,"""NIH research helps explain how antibody treatment led to sustained remission of HIVlike virusScientists at the National Institutes of Health have found that the presence of the protein alpha4 beta7 integrin on the surface of HIV and its monkey equivalent  simian immunodeficiency virus or SIV  may help explain why an antibody protected monkeys from SIV in previous experimentsIn October 2016 researchers reported that they had achieved sustained SIV remission in monkeys using a monkey antibody similar to the human drug vedolizumab which is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating ulcerative colitis and Crohns disease The mechanism behind this observation has been unclear but a new report presented today at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Seattle provides cluesScientists have known that alpha4 beta7 integrin is a guthoming receptor present at high levels on the immunesystem cells that HIV and SIV preferentially infect In the new study scientists found that maturing HIV and SIV particles acquire alpha4 beta7 as they emerge from an infected cell presenting researchers with a new target for HIV prevention and treatment and shedding light on how HIV disease developsWe expected the antibody to attack alpha4 beta7 on immune cells and reduce their movement to the gut where HIV and SIV typically decimate the cells early in infection said Anthony S Fauci MD director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID part of NIH who coauthored the report as chief of the Laboratory of Immunoregulation LIRInstead our team found that antialpha4 beta7 antibody binds not only to cells but also to HIV and SIV This likely explains at least in part our previous observation that SIVinfected monkeys treated with antibody to alpha4 beta7 and antiretroviral therapy controlled the virus very effectively long after all treatment endedStudies conducted by Dr Fauci and colleagues in his laboratory and at Emory University Atlanta between 2014 and 2016 showed that a laboratoryderived monkey antibody against alpha4 beta7 reduced the transmission of SIV to uninfected monkeys and induced sustained SIV remission in infected monkeys Dr Faucis team undertook the current study to understand whyHIV and SIV acquire their envelopes from the membranes of the cells from which they emerge capturing some cellular proteins in the process Led by Paolo Lusso MD PhD chief of the Viral Pathogenesis Section in the LIR researchers discovered that HIV buds from membranes of immune cells precisely where alpha4 beta7 is concentrated and incorporates the alpha4 beta7 into its envelope protein In this way the virus hijacks a cellular protein to sharpen its assault on the immune systemSubsequently Drs Lusso Fauci and colleagues conducted experiments to understand the function and prevalence of the alpha4 beta7 protein on the HIV envelope They demonstrated in a mouse model that HIV bearing the protein homes to the gut They also showed in cell culture that HIV infects alpha4 beta7recognizing gut cells and their neighbors in a dramatically more efficient manner when the virus bears the protein than when it does notFinally they demonstrated that blood samples taken from 33 HIVinfected people and 12 SIVinfected monkeys at multiple time points all had at least some virus bearing alpha4 beta7 The percentage of virus particles with the protein was greatest in blood samples taken during the early stage of infection when the virus multiplies in the alpha4 beta7rich immune cells of the gutBased on these findings the researchers believe the protein is critical to the initial phase of infection which has a major influence on the subsequent development of HIV diseaseThe scientists next step is to conduct a study to try to prove that the presence of alpha4 beta7 on SIV explains the protective effect of the antialpha4 beta7 antibody observed in the earlier monkey experimentsMeanwhile Dr Fauci and other NIAID researchers are enrolling participants in a clinical trial to determine whether shortterm treatment with vedolizumab in combination with antiretroviral therapy ART can generate sustained HIV remission in people living with HIVThe small earlyphase clinical trial at the NIH Clinical Research Center in Bethesda Maryland is testing whether a 30week course of vedolizumab is safe and tolerable and allows study participants immune systems to control HIV when they temporarily stop taking ART Preliminary results are expected by the end of

35 years The study volunteers were randomly assigned to receive either the investigational vaccine regimen or placebo injections Study participants received six injections over 18 months As with all NIAIDsponsored HIV prevention trials the safety of HVTN 702 study participants was closely monitored throughout the trial and participants were offered the local standard of care for preventing HIV including access to oral preexposure prophylaxis PrEPIn the January 23 2020 interim analysis the DSMB examined data from 2694 volunteers who received the investigational vaccine regimen and 2689 volunteers who received the placebo injection The analysis looked at how many participants were diagnosed with HIV after at least 60 of the participants had been in the study for more than 18 months  enough time for the vaccine regimen to stimulate an immune response In this analysis 129 HIV infections occurred among the vaccine recipients and 123 HIV infections occurred among the placebo

and 12 are Black Officials also report an increase in people receiving their second dose of Jynneos over the past few weeks The recommended time between the first and second vaccine dose is 28 days As a reminder Jynneos is a twodose vaccine and it is important to receive the second dose in the series to have the best protection against monkeypox Walensky said She added that current data suggests peak protection occurs 14 days after the second dose Its the early adopters or as Walensky describes them the people who roll up their sleeves before theyve reached the pharmacy that account for most vaccinations so far Officials recognize were entering a more challenging phase in terms of getting more reluctant people vaccinated as well In an effort to hunker down and go deeper into communities at risk the White House plans to build on their previous success with outreach at large pride events and expand the pilot program to smaller community events said Bob Fenton White House Monkeypox Response Coordinator Effective interventions hinge on targeting men of color as well which is part of the CDC Monkeypox Vaccine Equity Pilot Project We have also seen the racial and ethnic makeup of this outbreak evolve Walensky said At first monkeypox cases were reported in primarily nonHispanic white men In the past few weeks however the demographics have shifted Now nonHispanic white men account for 26 of cases nonHispanic black men for 38 and Hispanic or Latino men for 25 of casesAs weve said equity must remain the cornerstone of our response Daskalakis said In terms of vaccine research the NIAID is sponsoring a study to evaluate the effectiveness of administering the Jynneos vaccine between layers of skin instead of under the skin for protection against monkeypox As of Aug 10 the FDA allowed the splitting of a single dose of Jynneos typically given under the skin or subcutaneously into five doses given between layers of the skin or intradermally Now researchers are looking at the practices safety and efficacy further in the trial Data shows monkeypox does not travel alone so using existing services that focus on HIV and sexually transmitted infections in affected communities is another strategy to educate and reduce monkeypox Daskalakis said For example 38 of 1969 people diagnosed with monkeypox had HIV and 41 had an STI in the prior year according to a study published in the CDCs Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on Sept 9 We quickly use this data to change how monkeypox services can be supported by public health departments clinics and communitybased organizations Daskalakis said The same people we need to test for HIV and sexually transmitted infections and lead to prevention and care are the same people who need monkeypoxrelated services like testing education and vaccines This important change in guidance  allows our frontline health departments and communitybased organizations to use their HIV and STI resources to accelerate us all to the end of the monkeypox outbreak""",WebMD,real,0,1550

Texas If theres going to be a public insurrection they know the battle lines will be dawn in Texas They know the patriot community is thick in Texas Thats why Texas is receiving more of these smart guillotines than any other state FEMAs first strike will occur in Texas our source saidThe Andrews AFB shipmentover 500 smart guillotineswas distributed by rail to FEMA zone six an area encompassing Texas New Mexico Louisiana Oklahoma Belgrade and Arkansas primarily red states likely to resist a declaration of Martial Law or a military incursion against the American peopleAfter Obama left office FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security kept the smart guillotine project alive using slush funds and black project money to fund three thousand of the villainous devices each of which reportedly cost seventeen million dollars FEMA ordered them from the Chinese our source added because the agency felt guilty about using MadeinAmerica products to execute Americans In addition the Chinese versions are less costlyThe Deep State and by association FEMA recognized that some of its own peoples heads might accidentally wind up on the chopping block They had to devise a way to stop the blade from lopping off friendly heads So when a person is face down waiting for the blade to fall the computer scans the face and iris If it matches a friendly face stored in a database the blade wont fall and the person is set free our source saidIf a person resists arm and leg restraints spring forth from recessed compartments rendering the victim immobile Moreover the smart guillotines employ biometric scanning including facial recognition technology to exonerate persons mistakenly placed on the guillotine for executionFor example the headrest has motion sensors and pressure plates that detect the presence of a human neck No operator is needed a computer drops and retracts a razorsharp weighted titanium blade which our source said can sever several hundred heads per sharpeningThe condemned person is secured with stocks at the bottom of the frame positioning the neck directly below the blade The blade is then released to quickly fall and forcefully decapitate the victim with a single clean pass so that the head falls into a basket below The smart guillotine retains the basic design while adding several scientific advancementsThe guillotine gained popularity during the French Revolution The device consists of a tall upright frame in which a weighted and angled blade is raised to the top and suspendedHe said the smart guillotine project was commissioned in 2011 at the request of former president Barrack Hussein Obama who had hoped during his term toand use the deadly apparatus against patriots and freedom fighters that challenged his oneworld government agenda The guillotine he added is the ideal method of execution for instilling fear among the massesThe technologically advanced guillotines he said are being manufactured in Beijing before being flown

909,1072,"""NIHfunded rodent study finds molecular link between adolescent alcohol use and adult anxietyNew preclinical research in rats has identified a link between adolescent alcohol exposure and specific molecular changes in the brain that contribute to increased anxiety in adulthood A large body of evidence demonstrates a strong relationship between alcohol and anxiety problems in humansThese findings provide insight into the mechanisms through which alcoholinduced brain changes during adolescence increase vulnerability to alcohol and anxiety problems in adulthood said George F Koob PhD director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism NIAAA part of the National Institutes of HealthThe new report is the latest installment of work led by NIAAA grantee Subhash C Pandey PhD professor and director of the NIAAAfunded Alcohol Research Center in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Illinois at Chicago and a Senior Research Career Scientist at Jesse Brown VA Medical Center in Chicago Dr Pandey and his colleagues have previously reported that rats exposed to alcohol during adolescence show greater anxietylike behavior as adults compared to nonalcohol exposed rats They have also shown that those effects were linked to two genes  brainderived neurotrophic factor Bdnf and activityregulated cytoskeletonassociated protein Arc  that nerve cells need to form new connections with each otherIn the current study the Pandey group focused on epigenetic changes that affect expression of the Arc protein in the amygdala a brain region linked to anxiety and alcohol misuse Epigenetic changes refer to DNA modifications that affect expression of a gene without altering the genes DNA sequence Specifically the researchers wanted to determine if expression of a relatively new class of genetic material known as enhancer RNA eRNA was influenced by adolescent alcohol exposure and if epigenetic mechanisms in turn influenced expression of the Arc eRNA and gene in the adult amygdala They also wanted to know whether this epigenetic mechanism played a role in anxietylike behavior in adult animals that were exposed to alcohol during adolescence A report of their findings is online in the journal Biological PsychiatryeRNAs are noncoding RNAs that do not encode into protein but regulate a target genes function thus representing crucial molecular events in gene expression explained Dr PandeyAs in their previous studies the researchers administered alcohol to adolescent rats using a binge drinkinglike model and examined the animals for anxietylike behaviors in adulthood including how blocking the activity of eRNAs specific to the Arc gene affected those behaviorsThey found that compared to adult animals without adolescent alcoholexposure the adolescent alcoholexposed rats displayed both decreased Arc eRNA expression and Arc gene expression in the amygdala as well as heightened anxietylike behavior in adulthood However a dose of alcohol reduced the anxietylike behavior and was associated with a reversal in Arc eRNA and Arc gene expression  suggesting that Arc contributes to anxietylike behaviorWe identified underlying epigenetic processes regulating Arc eRNA expression in adulthood that are affected by adolescent alcohol exposure said Dr Pandey Adolescent alcohol exposure produces persistent effects on eRNA related to Arc gene expression via epigenetic reprogramming and lower eRNA levels in the amygdala These effects in turn increased the susceptibility to anxiety in adulthoodLastly Dr Pandey and his colleagues showed that directly blocking Arc eRNA in the amygdala of control rats led to anxietylike behaviors demonstrating that Arc eRNA expression in the amygdala regulates anxietylike behaviorsThese findings provide a better understanding of how adolescent alcohol exposure can lead to lifelong biomolecular changes that increase the risk for adultonset psychiatric disorders said Dr PandeyFurther research is necessary to determine if these newly identified molecular targets might lead to the development of better therapies for pathologies related to adolescent alcohol exposureThis press release describes a basic research finding Basic research increases our understanding of human behavior and biology which is foundational to advancing new and better ways to prevent

Natural History for his first visit but ended up on a bench outside the museum sobbing in the rain because she couldnt even get through the first hurdle of standing in line I just wanted to be there with my kid she says Kulick got sick with COVID19 at the start of the pandemic in March 2020 9 months before the first vaccine would be approved Now she is among the estimated one in five infected Americans or 19 whose symptoms developed into long COVID Kulick also is now vaccinated and boosted Had a vaccine been available sooner could it have protected her from long COVID Evidence is starting to show its likely The best way not to have long COVID is not to have COVID at all says Leora Horwitz MD a professor of population health and medicine at New York Universitys Grossman School of Medicine To the extent that vaccination can prevent you from getting COVID at all then it helps to reduce long COVID And just as vaccines reduce the risk of severe disease hospitalization and death they also seem to reduce the risk of long COVID if people do get breakthrough infections People with more serious initial illness appear more likely to have prolonged symptoms but those with milder disease can certainly get it too Youre more likely to have long COVID with more severe disease and we have ample evidence that vaccination reduces the severity of disease Horwitz says We also now have quite a lot of evidence that vaccination does reduce your risk of long COVID  probably because it reduces your risk of severe diseaseThere is little consensus about how much vaccines can lower the risk of longterm COVID symptoms but several studies suggest that number lies anywhere from 15 to more than 80 That might seem like a big variation but infectious disease experts argue that trying to interpret the gap isnt as important as noticing whats consistent across all these studies Vaccines do offer some protection but its incomplete says Ziyad AlAly MD chief of research and development at the Veterans Affairs St Louis Health Care System AlAly who has led several large studies on long COVID says focusing on the fact that vaccines do offer some protection is a much better public health message than looking at the different levels of risk Vaccines do a miraculous job for what they were designed to do says AlAly Vaccines were designed to reduce the risk of hospitalization  and for that vaccines are still holding up even with all the changes in the virus Still Elena Azzolini MD PhD head of the Humanitas Research Hospitals vaccination center in Milan Italy thinks some studies may have underestimated the level of long COVID protection from vaccines because of limits in the study methods such as not including enough women who are more affected by long COVID Her recent study which looked at 2560 health care professionals working in nine Italian centers from March 2020 to April 2022 focused on the risk for healthy women and men in their 20s to their 70s In the paper published in July in TheJournal of the American Medical Association Azzolini and her fellow researchers reported that two or three doses of vaccine reduced the risk of hospitalization from COVID19 from 42 among those who are unvaccinated to 16 or 17 In other words they found unvaccinated people in the study were nearly three times as likely to have serious symptoms for longer than 4 weeks But Azzolini and AlAly still say that even for the vaccinated as long as COVID is around masks are necessary Thats because current vaccines dont do enough to reduce transmission says AlAly The only way that can really help stop transmission is covering our nose and mouth with a mask he saysHow Vaccinations Affect People Who Already Have Long COVID Some long COVID patients have said they got better after they get boosted while some say theyre getting worse says Horwitz who is also a lead investigator at the National Institutes of Healths flagship RECOVER program a 4year research project to study long COVID across the US The NIH is still recruiting volunteers for these studies which are also open to people who have never had COVID One study published in The British Medical Journal in May analyzed survey data of more than 28000 people infected with COVID in the United Kingdom and found a 13 reduction in longterm symptoms after a first dose of the vaccine although it was unclear from the data if the improvement was sustained A second dose was associated with another 8 improvement over a 2month period Its reassuring that we see an average modest improvement in symptoms not an average worsening in symptoms says Daniel Ayoubkhani principal statistician at the UK Office for National Statistics and lead author of the study Of course he says the experience will differ among different people It doesnt appear that vaccination is the silver bullet thats going to eradicate long COVID he says but evidence from multiple studies suggests vaccines may help people with longterm symptoms Akiko Iwasaki PhD an immunobiologist at the Yale University School of Medicine told a White House summit in July that one of the best ways to prevent long COVID is to develop the next generation of vaccines that also prevent milder cases by blocking transmission in the first place Back in Queens NY Kulick is now triple vaccinated Shes due for a fourth dose soon but admits shes terrified every time that shes going to get sicker In her Facebook support group for long COVID she reads that most people with prolonged symptoms handle it well She has also noticed some of her symptoms eased after her first two doses of vaccine Since being diagnosed Kulick learned she has a genetic condition EhlersDanlos syndrome which affects connective tissues that support skin joints organs and blood vessels and which her doctors say may have made her more prone to long COVID Shes also being screened for autoimmune diseases but for now the only relief she has found has come from

several important limitations and that no one should change their diet based on the results It wouldnt impact my fish consumption at all said Sancy Leachman MD who directs the melanoma program at Oregon Health  Science Universitys Knight Cancer Institute in Portland Fish are part of a healthy diet particularly if it replaces less healthy proteins such as beef Even the authors of the study advised caution when interpreting the findings I wouldnt encourage anyone to change their fish consumption habits just because of this paper said study leader Eunyoung Cho ScD an epidemiologist at Brown University in Providence RI Fish is cardioprotective and is related to reduced risk of developing certain cancers too The study quickly generated headlines and was the most viewed article of the journal Cancer Causes  Control within a day of its publication on June 9 Cho who is on the editorial board of the journal analyzed the results of a study funded by the National Institutes of Health NIH and Association for the Advancement of Retired Persons AARP that began in the 1990s and explored possible links between fish consumption and developing different forms of cancer Previous research from this project had shown eating fish was associated with an increased risk of melanoma  but no other type of cancer Cho speculated that the risk is due to contaminants such as mercury and arsenic in fish But she was curious to see if she could find a connection between the amount of fish consumed and the risk of developing skin cancer At the beginning of the study people reported how much fish they had consumed over the previous year which varied widely by person Then researchers tracked participants for 15 years counting who developed cancer and who did not Dietary recall can be difficult people often say they cant remember what they ate yesterday much less 1 year ago Still dietitian Clare Collins PhD of the University of Newcastle in Australia noted that previous research showed that the dietary recall tool for this study is reliableNIH researchers never checked to see how their diet changed over time as this was a study meant to observe changes in health status starting from a baseline point The researchers assumed that the level of fish intake recorded at the beginning of the study remained steady Of 491000 people tracked in the study 5000 developed malignant melanoma and another 3300 developed melanoma cells on the skin surface People who ate the most fish  an average of about 15 ounces per day  were 23 more likely to develop melanoma than the lightest fish eaters who averaged 01 ounces per day That risk is modest Leachman said especially for people with red hair who she said are 400 more likely to get melanoma than others A 23 increase in the whole scheme of things is not nearly as important as not getting sunburned if youre a redhead Leachman said And what about the sun Sun exposure is the principal risk factor for developing melanoma and the researchers didnt account for that factor People who developed melanoma during the study may simply have spent more time in tanning beds or on the beach  or perhaps fishing and then eating their catch Cho and colleagues tried to consider the effects of solar radiation by looking at average sun exposure times in the places where the participants in the study were living when the research began Using that framework variation in sun exposure made no difference to melanoma risk but Leachman said the technique isnt foolproof They assumed that they were going to get a certain amount of ultraviolet light just based on where they lived We dont know how long they lived there or if they really had ultraviolet exposure or not Leachman said Someone in presumably less sunny Pennsylvania could get more sun than someone in sundrenched Arizona depending on their lifestyle and habits The kind of study Cho published cannot account for individual behaviors related to sun exposure a limitation her team readily acknowledges Nor does it include information about moles or hair color  important considerations for skin cancers It may be that redheads with moles who barely ate any fish developed melanoma at higher rates than anyone else but the data dont allow for that kind of analysisChos group found that canned tuna and any type of fish that wasnt fried were associated with a higher risk of developing melanoma as people reported eating more of those products However people who said they ate greater quantities of fried fish had a lower risk of melanoma a counterintuitive finding that she said warrants further research Given that the study showed only a modest chance of developing melanoma regardless of fish intake and left so many questions unanswered what was the point Other journals declined to publish this paper Cho acknowledged but she defended the article as a step toward better understanding the health impact of environmental contaminants in fish Leachman agreed These kinds of studies are very important to do They have large data sets where you can start to see trends that may be important she said They can help you identify things that might be related These experiments are hypothesis generating I already published an article showing that total mercury level is related to skin cancer and we know very well that in the US fish consumption is the major source of mercury contamination Cho said So I naturally thought that fish consumption may be associated with increased risk of skin cancer too Cho said she believed the findings confirm that hypothesis Cho said the next step would be to measure blood levels of different contaminants such as mercury and arsenic in people with melanoma to determine which toxin is the biggest driver of melanoma She said she plans to seek funding for that research Meanwhile pass the salmon  but go light on the salt""",WebMD,real,0,1740

vision lossChildren who undergo cataract surgery as infants have a 22 risk of glaucoma 10 years later whether or not they receive an intraocular lens implant The findings come from the National Eye Institute NEIfunded Infant Aphakic Treatment Study which today published 10year followup results in JAMA Ophthalmology NEI is part of the National Institutes of HealthThese findings underscore the need for longterm glaucoma surveillance among infant cataract surgery patients They also provide some measure of assurance that it is not necessary to place an intraocular lens at the time of cataract surgery said Michael F Chiang MD director of NEIThe results challenge the notion that replacing the childs lens with an implanted one protects the child from developing glaucoma a belief among some pediatric ophthalmology surgeons said the trials principal investigator Scott R Lambert MD professor of ophthalmology at Stanford University Palo Alto CaliforniaAt the time of cataract removal the 114 study participants ages 16 months had been born with cataract in one eye In the operating room the infants were randomly assigned to receive an artificial lens implant or go without a lens a condition called aphakiaAnnually fewer than 2500 children in the US are born with cataract a clouding of the eyes lens Surgery is used to remove and replace the cloudy lens To allow the childs eye to focus light properly following removal of the cataract an intraocular lens implant may be placed at surgery or the eye may be left aphakic and a contact lens or glasses if both eyes have had a cataract removed may be used to provide the needed correctionI tell patients parents that implanting a lens in the infants eye is like buying your childs wedding shoes when theyre an infant It is hard to predict what final power the intraocular lens should have without knowing how that eye will grow over the years so placing a lens at the time of cataract removal in an infant involves estimation and may not turn out to be correct Hence the eye may end up needing strong glasses or even replacement of the original lens implant said the lead author on the paper Sharon F Freedman MD a pediatric glaucoma specialist at Duke University Durham North CarolinaChildren who undergo cataract removal have an increased risk of glaucoma a sightthreatening condition that damages the optic nervethe connection between the eye and brain Scientists speculate that surgery to remove the cataract interferes with the maturation of how fluid flows out of the infants eye leading to increased eye pressure and optic nerve damage in some of these eyesAmong the 110 children who were available for reexamination at 10 years 25 eyes 24 had developed glaucoma and 21 eyes 20 were glaucoma suspects due to elevated eye pressure However visual acuity was similar among those eyes that developed glaucoma compared to those eyes that had not The researchers found no evidence of glaucomarelated eye damage assessed by imaging of the optic nerve head to measure the retinal nerve fiber layer thicknessThe investigators attribute the absence of glaucomarelated eye damage to close patient monitoring as any sign of glaucoma was aggressively treatedWhile the lifetime glaucoma risk trajectory for patients who have cataract removal as infants remains unknown this study found that the risk of glaucoma after cataract removal rose from 9 at 1 year to 17 at 5 years and to 22 at 10 yearsAny child who has had a cataract removed needs to be seen by an eye care provider once a year at a minimum said Freedman Any child diagnosed with glaucoma or abovenormal intraocular pressure without signs of ocular damage  what we called glaucoma suspect  should be monitored every four to six months depending upon the stability of the condition and the health of the eyeAt 10 years 40 of the followed children had developed the diagnosis of glaucoma or glaucoma suspect A glaucoma suspect is an eye that has above normal eye pressure or another feature suspicious but not diagnostic of glaucomaThe findings also confirm that the timing of cataract surgery is a balancing act Whereas surgery at younger ages increases glaucoma risk delaying surgery increases risk of amblyopia a leading cause of visual impairment in children that results when cataract in one eye causes the brain to ignore signals from that eye and favor the other eyeFuture studies of glaucoma following cataract surgery in children will benefit from groundwork by the Infant Aphakic Treatment Study Freedman said collaboration among the 12

988,1284,"""NIHsupported researchers find link between allergen in red meat and heart diseaseA team of researchers says it has linked sensitivity to an allergen in red meat to the buildup of plaque in the arteries of the heart While high saturated fat levels in red meat have long been known to contribute to heart disease for people in general the new finding suggests that a subgroup of the population may be at heightened risk for a different reason  a food allergen The study which is supported by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute part of the National Institutes of Health appears in Arteriosclerosis Thrombosis and Vascular Biology ATVB a peerreviewed journal of the American Heart AssociationThis novel finding from a small group of subjects from Virginia raises the intriguing possibility that allergy to red meat may be an underrecognized factor in heart disease said study leader Coleen McNamara MD a professor of medicine in the Cardiovascular Research Center of the University of Virginia Health System Charlottesville These preliminary findings underscore the need for further clinical studies in larger populations from diverse geographic regions and additional laboratory workThe number of people with red meat allergies in the United States is unclear but researchers estimate that it may be 1 percent of the population in some areas The number of people who develop blood antibodies to the red meat allergen without having fullblown symptoms is much higher  as much as 20 percent of the population in some areas the researchers sayOnly in recent years did scientists identify the main allergen in red meat called galactose13galactose or alphaGal a type of complex sugar They also found that a tick  the Lone Star tick  sensitizes people to this allergen when it bites them That is why red meat allergies tend to be more common where these ticks are more prevalent such as the Southeastern United States but also extending to other areas including Long Island New YorkResearchers have suspected for some time that allergens can trigger certain immunological changes that might be associated with plaque buildup and artery blockages but no one had identified a specific substance that is responsible for this effect In the current study researchers showed for the first time that a specific blood marker for red meat allergy was associated with higher levels of arterial plaque or fatty deposits on the inner lining of the arteries The blood marker they identified is a type of antibody immunoglobulin or IgE that is specific to the alphaGal allergen To identify this blood marker the researchers analyzed blood samples from 118 adults and detected antibodies to alphaGal indicating sensitivity to red meat in 26 percent of them Using an imaging procedure the researchers found that the quantity of plaque was 30 percent higher in the alphaGal sensitized patients than in the nonsensitized patients These plaques a hallmark of atherosclerosis hardening of the arteries also tended to be more structurally unstable which means that they have an increased likelihood of causing heart attack and strokeThe evidence for a link between red meat allergens and coronary artery disease is still preliminary the researchers noted so they plan to conduct detailed animal and human studies to confirm their initial findings Currently the only treatment for red meat allergy once it is diagnosed is strict avoidance of red meat While more studies are needed the current work provides a potential new approach or target for preventing or treating heart disease in a subgroup of people who are sensitized to red meat said Ahmed Hasan MD PhD a medical officer and program director in NHLBIs Atherothrombosis  Coronary Artery Disease Branch For now consumers are encouraged to follow current recommendations for a hearthealthy lifestyle This includes adapting a healthy diet such as eating plenty of vegetables fruits whole grains and other hearthealthy foods Lean red meats can be part of a heart healthy diet for those who are not allergic Other hearthealthy lifestyle changes also include aiming for a healthy weight managing stress getting more exercise and quitting smokingIn addition to funding from NHLBI this study was also funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID NIH funding support includes

only the disease itself but also the workplace Through referrals that come in from across the country Darras says he has a realtime view of the pandemic and the enormous obstacles employees with long COVID face trying to explain and prove their condition Its terrifying to be suffering from a disease and a problem that theres no cure for yet says Darras a founding partner of law firm DarrasLaw in Ontario CA And having your job and your familys financial future hanging in the balance  is horrific for the employee Already experts are predicting that the economic fallout and ripple effect of long COVID could be in the trillions of dollars Its a very significant fraction of the total workforce  in a tight labor market environment as were in its a really important factor says Matt Craven MD a partner with consulting firm McKinsey  Co and author of an upcoming report that estimates that acute and long COVID will cost the US economy a billion productive days in 2022 Meanwhile there is still much about long COVID that remains unclear The CDC describes it as a wide range of new returning or ongoing health problems that happen at least 4 weeks after infection In one recent large study involving 100000 people in Scotland one in 20 COVID patients said they had not recovered at all more than half a year after the start of their infection while about 40 reported being only partially recovered Long COVID is a term that we use a lot but its really not welldefined because different people have been impacted by COVID in very different ways says Cheryl BatesHarris the senior disability advocacy specialist with the National Disability Rights Network Employees with long COVID generally fall into two categories those with debilitating longterm symptoms that prevent them from working altogether and those with milder to moderate symptoms that allow them to remain productive with the right workplace accommodationsEmployees may not realize they can ask for accommodations experts say while inexperienced employers may not know how to help or what to do with an employee who suddenly may only be able to function at 50 capacity In a situation where many industries are laborconstrained right now the importance of maintaining the longterm employeremployee relationship is greater than ever before says Craven who leads McKinseys public health response to COVID19 What flexibility are they able to offer so that theyre not permanently losing a worker who could be a great asset for them over the longer term For employees with mild to moderate long COVID symptoms employers should provide a safe and supportive environment to openly discuss how they can help advocates say It is also important to be educated about long COVID Under the Americans with Disabilities Act employers are expected to make reasonable accommodations for people with a disability but advocates encourage employers to set a positive example by having these conversations and listening to their employees needs regardless of their status under the Disabilities Act You would hate to throw away years of work experience and years of training thats gone into that person simply because theres a part of their job they cant do or theyre now experiencing health impairments BatesHarris says If an employee cannot walk long distances because they become out of breath easily or tire quickly employers can offer telework as an option where feasible allowing an employee to work from home experts suggest They can make sure the employee is equipped at home with the devices and tools they need to do their job well If an employees job does not allow them to work from home an employer can reduce their physical exertion make sure they are given enough or extra rest breaks or give them more time to use inhalers and nebulizers for shortness of breath for example They can also provide individual mobility devices like electric scooters so that an employee can move around without exhausting themselves says BatesHarrisThose who have brain fog may prefer a quieter workspace There are also apps that can help including ones that can help workers keep track of tasks and stay organized Employers can also provide a shorter workday or set a more flexible work schedule while maintaining employees fulltime status I dont care if my people come in at 4 in the morning and work till 10 am Darras says Whatever kind of flexible schedule works for them I want to make sure that Im flexible in making my premises accessible A collaborative workplace environment and using shared tools and documents can help lessen interruptions if an employee is sick or absent Zoom meetings that are recorded can also help employees catch up and stay connected An employee may request different responsibilities and tasks more suited to their health condition As an employer himself Darras has tried to make these accommodations saying its a chance for employers to figure out how to keep staff happy A Legal Right to Go on Leave Ultimately long COVID requires employers to be more flexible experts say If a worker is exhausted from an intense week they may need to take time off to recover or attend medical appointments Bates noted that one of the biggest complaints her organization gets are calls regarding time off and attendance While every case is different in the US the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Family Medical Leave Act grant many workers a number of protected rights including unpaid sick leave Those working for a company with 50 or more employees or for a government or public entity for at least 1250 hours over the course of 12 months may qualify for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year for family and medical reasons The Leave Act protects an employee from being fired for going on extended leave and requires employers to continue their group health benefits during that period of absence If people have long COVID symptoms so severe that they cant work at all they may qualify for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits advocates say But they caution that the process to qualify may not be quick or easy and is compounded by the fact that many with long COVID cant work due to extreme fatigue and brain fog making the physical process of applying even more dauntingAs many pandemicrelated costs shift away from the government back to individuals and the private sector employers will need to decide what kind of workplace benefits and health coverage they offer says Pooja Kumar MD a senior partner with McKinsey who leads the firms work on US public health What do their benefits structures look like How matched are they to the known impact from long COVID she says adding that it is not just about benefits and accommodations How do you actually continue to motivate a workforce when people are functioning at 80 because of physiological reasons Darras says employers should also have a COVID19 safety plan and make sure the companys short and longterm disability insurance benefits do not have limits on selfreported conditions  symptoms such as pain and chronic fatigue that are difficult to verify using medical tests but that are common among long COVID patients It is something he has done at his own firm and he suggests employers ask for guidance from a regional office for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration if necessary Parttime employees should not be forgotten either advocates say Employers can consider what they can do to help parttime staff meet the requirements to make them eligible for disability insurance While many of these accommodations may cost money advocates stress the longterm benefits The institutional knowledge and experience that current employees have far outweighs anything theyre going to get by hiring a new person off the street and training BatesHarris says Employers who have experience hiring people with disabilities learned long ago that the cost of accommodating an employee far outweighs the cost of hiring new employees With less than 3 years of information on COVID19 Craven also stresses the importance of being agile Create policies now but revisit them over time based on new information how people are using them how theyre working for employees how theyre working for employers he says Version one doesnt have to be perfect Employers can also reach out to

of Cancer finds that cancer patients in the United States shoulder a large amount of cancer care costs In 2019 the national patient economic burden associated with cancer care was 2109 billion made up of patient outofpocket costs of 1622 billion and patient time costs of 487 billion Patient time costs reflect the value of time that patients spend traveling to and from health care waiting for care and receiving care according to the reportThe report appearing October 26 2021 in JNCI The Journal of the National Cancer Institute is the most comprehensive examination of patient economic burden for cancer care to date and includes information on patient outofpocket spending by cancer site stage of disease at diagnosis and phase of care While this analysis is about the costs that are directly incurred by patients which are critical to patient finances the total overall costs of cancer care and lost productivity in the United States are much largerAmong adults aged 65 years and older who had Medicare coverage average annualized net outofpocket costs for medical services and prescription drugs across all cancer sites were highest in the initial phase of care defined as the first 12 months following diagnosis 2200 and 243 respectively and the endoflife phase defined as the 12 months before death among survivors who died 3823 and 448 respectively and lowest in the continuing phase the months between the initial and endoflife phases 466 and 127 respectively Across all cancer sites average annualized net patient outofpocket costs for medical services in the initial and endoflife phases of care were lowest for patients originally diagnosed with localized disease compared with more advanced stage diseaseAs the costs of cancer treatment continue to rise greater attention to addressing patient medical financial hardship including difficulty paying medical bills high levels of financial distress and delaying care or forgoing care altogether because of cost is warranted said Karen E Knudsen MBA PhD chief executive officer American Cancer Society These findings can help inform efforts to minimize the patient economic burden of cancer and specific estimates may be useful in studies of the costeffectiveness of interventions related to cancer prevention diagnosis treatment and survivorship careThe annual report is a collaborative effort among the American Cancer Society the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC the National Cancer Institute NCI part of the National Institutes of Health and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries The report provides annual information about cancer occurrence and trends in the United States Part 1 of this annual report released in July 2021 focused on national cancer statisticsAnalyses of the differences in patient economic burden by cancer type found substantial variation in patient outofpocket costs reflecting differences in treatment intensity and duration as well as survival In 2019 national outofpocket costs were highest for breast 314 billion prostate 226 billion colorectal 146 billion and lung 135 billion cancers reflecting the higher prevalence of these cancersIn the modern era of cancer research we have to think about treatment costs and how they impact our patients As exciting and promising as cancer research is we are keenly aware of the issue of financial toxicity for these patients said Norman E Ned Sharpless MD director of NCI Therapies that are highly effective are no doubt good news but if they are unaffordable it is not the total kind of progress we would like to see Finding ways to ensure that not just some but all patients get access to therapies that are beneficial to them is an important goal we must continue to strive for in the cancer community This report will help guide us toward achieving that goalThe cost of having cancer is enormous and an extreme burden on people and families particularly for those who are uninsured or underinsured Prevention is key to lowering outofpocket costs said Karen Hacker MD MPH director of CDCs National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Unfortunately we know that many of these same people also have lower cancer screening use and may end up paying more for their cancer care Access to the right cancer screening tests at the right time is an important step toward health equity and we must work to make this a realityThe authors say that in addition to morbidity and mortality from cancer and cost of cancer treatment by insurance carriers outofpocket and patient time costs are other metrics that highlight the immense economic burden of cancermaking it a public health priority Estimates of patient outofpocket and time costs can inform discussions between providers and

Publishers Moscow 1972 Volume 28 pages 391404Translated Clemens Dutt Edited by Robert DaglishTranscriptionHTML Markup David Walters  Robert CymbalaOnline Version V I Lenin Internet Archive May 2002Stormy ovation Comrades allow me to begin by briefly mentioning the chief facts relating to our food policy I think these brief remarks will be useful in enabling us to form a correct judgement of the significance of the resolution we are recommending today for adoption by the AllRussia Central Executive Committee They should also enable us to form an opinion of our whole food policy in general and of the role which now when a difficult change is coming falls to the organised proletariat that vanguard and chief buttress of Soviet Russia and the socialist revolutionOur food policy has been marked by three major acts which taken chronologically are as follows firstthe decision to form Poor Peasants Committees a step which lies at the very basis of our food policy and which moreover was a tremendously important turningpoint in the whole course of development and structure of our revolution By taking this step we crossed the boundary dividing the bourgeois from the socialist revolution By themselves the victory of the working class in the cities and the transfer of all factories to the proletarian state would not have been enough to create and consolidate the foundation of a socialist system if we had not also created for ourselves not a general peasant but a really proletarian buttress in the countryside In October we had to confine ourselves to uniting the proletariat and the peasants in general as a whole And thanks to this alliance we were able rapidly to destroy the landlord system and sweep it off the face of the earth But it was only when we proceeded to organise the poor peasants the peasant proletariat and semiproletariat that a durable alliance could be formed between the mass of the urban proletariat and rural proletariat Only then could the war against the kulaks and the peasant bourgeoisie be fought in real earnest This radical step continues to be the keystone of our food policyThe second step less important perhaps was the decree passed with the participation and on the initiative of our representatives the decree on utilising the cooperative societies There we resolved that we must make use of the machinery created by the cooperatives and capitalist society in general and which for obvious reasons was weaker in Russia than in Western Europe In this respect we were guilty of many sins and many omissions in the towns and big proletarian centres as well as in the countryside Here we are up against a lack of understanding and ability prejudices and traditions which tend to repel us from the cooperatives It is quite natural that there should be many nonproletarians in the upper ranks of the cooperative movement We must fight these people who are capable of swinging over to the bourgeoisie and the counterrevolutionary elements and their scheming But at the same time we must preserve this machinery the cooperative machinerywhich is likewise a capitalist heritagethis machinery of distribution among millions of people without which we cannot build socialism with any success In this respect the Food Commissariat has outlined a correct policy but we have not yet put it fully into effect The proposals we are submitting today to the AllRussia Central Executive Committee on behalf of the Communist group which insists that the cooperative machinery be utilised are one more step in the same direction We must know how to combat the undesirable top officials in the cooperative machinerywe have forces and authority enough for that for it would be silly to think they can put up any serious resistance We must know how to combat them but we must utilise the cooperative machinery without fail so as not to squander our forces so that this machine may be united and so that the Communists may devote their energies not only to political but also to organisational work and make technical use of the machinery which stands ready for this workthe cooperative machineryThe third step in our food policy is the formation of workers food organisations 1lore a responsible task confronts you the food workers Our path is the right path for us to follow and we must see to it that it is followed by all the Commissariats It is a measure of general social and class importance as well as of importance for food supplies To make the socialist revolution lasting a new class must run the country We know that prior to 18612 it was the feudal landowners who were the power that governed Russia We know that since then generally speaking the power that governed was the bourgeoisie those from the wealthy The permanence of the socialist revolution will depend on the extent we can elevate the new class the proletariat to the work of government have Russia governed by the proletariat We must make this work of government a step towards the universal training of the working people in the art of governing the state a training not derived from books or newspapers speeches or pamphlets but from practice enabling everyone to try his hand at this workThat comrades is the chief stage in our food policy which at the same time is indicative of the very character of its structure Very responsible duties here confront our food supply comrades It need scarcely be said that there is no more cruel and dreadful calamity than famine that the people are naturally driven to impatience anger and indignation by every flop in this sphere for it is a calamity that cannot be endured Nor need it be said that the Food Commissariats task is a most difficult one You know and the comrades from the trade unions know it particularly how much chaos and disorder there is in running the big factories in keeping stock of their output Yet this is a thousand times easier than keeping stock of food which is gathered in by millions of peasants But we have no alternative There is a general food shortage in the country There is not enough to go roundWhat do we mean when we say that certain foodstuffs are scarce It means we could avoid starvation although living on reduced rations if we were now to distribute them among the whole population if every peasant were to turn over all his produce if everybody were to cut consumption somewhat below the standard of sufficiencybecause there is not enough for a full standard all roundif every peasant were to agree to reduce his consumption somewhat below the standard of sufficiency and turn over all the rest to the state and if we distributed it all properly But if we set ourselves this aim it is obviously impossible to carry it out by ordinary means amidst the present state of economic disruption and with our nationwide inefficiencywe are only just getting the knack we had nowhere to get it from before If there is a shortage of food it means  what does it mean It means that if you were to sanction free trade when there is a shortage of vitally essential foodstuffs the result would be frantic profiteering and prices would be inflated to what is called monopoly or famine prices and only a few top people with incomes considerably above the average would be able to satisfy their needs at these fantastic prices while the vast majority of the people would starve That is what it means when there is a food shortage in the country when the country is in a state of famine Ever since the imperialists began to march on Russia she has been surrounded They cannot come out openly with their predatory plans but that does not mean the end of their intervention as Comrade Kamenev has rightly remarked We are a besieged country a besieged fortress In this besieged fortress want is inevitable And therefore the Food Commissariats job is the most difficult organisational job of all the CommissariatsOur enemy today if we take the enemy within is not so much the capitalist or landownerthis exploiting minority was easy to vanquish and it has been It is the profiteer and the bureaucrat And every peasant is a profiteer by inclination who has a chance to line his pockets taking advantage of the desperate want and agonising famine in the cities and in some of the villages And you know very well especially the comrades from the trade unions that the urge the tendency to go in for profiteering occurs in the industrial centres too when certain goods are not to be had or are scarce and that everybody who manages to lay his hands on them tries to hoard and make a profit out of them If we were to allow free trade prices would at once be inflated to fantastic levels levels beyond the reach of the vast majority of peopleThat comrades is the situation and that is why among the less educated people exhausted as they are and worn out by starvation and suffering there is a tendency or an undefined feeling of resentment and anger against the comrades engaged in food supplies They are all people who cannot think cannot see further than the end of their noses and it seems to them that food could be procured somehow They have heard that there is food in some place or other that somebody went there and got somebut they are incapable of calculating on a large scale whether there is enough for ten million people and how much is required for such a number It seems to them that someone is holding things up that our food workers are putting obstacles in their way They do not understand that the food workers are acting like wise and thrifty managers saying that if you observe the utmost stringency and the utmost organisation you shall at best at the very best be able to maintain a standard that will keep you from starvation even if it does fall short of sufficiency This is the position the country is in for we have been cut off from the chief foodsupplying centresSiberia and the Donets region we have been cut off from fuel and raw material food for the population and for industry without which the country is forced to suffer the most desperate agoniesThe food workers are acting like sensible managers They say we must stick together which is the only way we can keep going we must take systematic action against all attempts by individuals acting for themselves only willing to pay any price to fill their own belly and who do not give a hang for anything else We must not think and act individually each for himself for that spells ruin We must combat such tendencies and habits which have been fostered in all of us in the millions of working people by capitalist private enterprise by the system of working for the market I shall sell and make my bit the more I make the less I shall starve and the more others will That is the accursed legacy of private property which left the people to starve even when there was enough food in the country when a measly minority grew rich both on wealth and on poverty while the people lived in want and perished in the war That comrades is the position with regard to our food policy That is the economic law which says that when there is a food shortage frantic profiteering is engendered by every step towards what is called free trade That is why all talk about free trade all attempts to encourage it are utterly pernicious and are a retreat a step back from that socialist constructive work which the Food Commissariat is doing amidst incredible difficulties in a fight against millions of profiteers whom we have inherited from capitalism with its old pettybourgeois privateproperty maxim Every man for himself and the devil take the hindmost If we cannot root out this evil we shall never build socialismOnly unity only the closest alliance achieved in everyday life in everyday work where it is hardest of all to achievein dividing up a crust of bread when bread is shortwill allow us really to build socialism We know that this cannot be accomplished in a single year that people who have suffered so long from hunger are tremendously impatient and demand that at least from time to time we retreat from this only correct food policy And we do have to retreat from it now and then but we shall not desert or depart from our policy as a wholeThat comrades was the situation six months ago when the food crisis reached its climax when we had no stocks at all when the Czech victories had robbed us of the greater part of the Volga region We had to consent to the pood and a half3 This measure cost us a big fight a sharp fight both sides were in a very bad state The food workers said Yes things are grim but we must not make them worse By giving relief to a few for a week we will be making things worse for the millions Others said You are demanding ideal organisation from people who are exhausted and starving you are demanding the impossible you must allow some relief even if it spoils the general policy for a while This measure will bring new courage and that is the main thing That was the plight we were in when we proposed the pood and a half idea We kept to the general fundamental radical line but when the position became unbearable we had to retreat from it to afford at least some temporary relief and preserve the peoples courage and moraleThe same thing is happening now when we are on the border line when six comparatively easy months are behind us and six hard months are about to begin To make this clear let me tell you that during the first half of 1918 the Food Commissariat procured 28000000 poods and during the second half 67000000 poods that is two and a half times as much So you can clearly see that the first halfyear is one of particularly dire and acute want whereas the second owing to the harvest offers an opportunity of improvement Now in 1919 the success of our food organisations thanks chiefly to the Poor Peasants Committees in the countryside and the workers food inspectors in the towns is immense and has enabled us to procure two and a half times as much grain But the success of the first year of our work when a new edifice had to be built and new methods tested was not and could not have been enough to ensure us supplies for the whole year although it afforded us a sixmonth respite That respite is coming to an end and another six months are beginning the most difficult and hardest of all We must bring all our resources into play to help the workers to secure them a short respite to improve their position in every way we can And it is only natural that the Presidium of the Moscow Soviet and its Chairman Kamenev should have been so insistent that we lay down our policy as clearly as possible and make a clearcut division between monopoly and nonmonopoly foodstuffs which would enable us to attain certain results if only for a time so that the workers in the towns and the nonagricultural areas might get at least some slight relief and gain new courage and energy These are particularly necessary just now when we are on the eve of these difficult six months but when there are signs that the forces in the imperialist camp and their attacks on us are slacking offComrade Kamenev it is true has mentioned not only signs but facts to show that in spite of the severe trials and reverses we suffered at Perm the Red Army is being built on a firm foundation that it can and will win The coming six months however will be very difficult and from the very outset we must therefore do whatever is necessary and possible to alleviate the situation and lay down a clearcut food policy That is our most urgent task There was a conflict over the pood and a half idea among us the Communists and it sometimes assumed acute forms But it has not weakened us Rather it has led us to examine our policy in an even more critical and cautious way There may be mutual recriminations but we are arriving at a decision which is being adopted rapidly and unanimously and which at this difficult juncture when we are beginning another and trying six months demands that we once more clarify for ourselves the reason why a situation has arisen which compels us once more to muster all our strength and strain every nerveWe have had an exception ally hard year and we are now on the verge of an even harder six months But every six months since the German revolution and since the beginning of ferment in Britain and France brings us nearer to the victory not only of the Russian revolution but of the world revolution as well That is the situation as it now stands We have decided to present a draft of the fundamental principles of food policy which we shall request the AllRussia Central Executive Committee to affirm so that it may be immediately embodied by the food workers in appropriate decrees that will enable us those in the centre the workers of the towns and the nonagricultural areas to multiply our efforts once more For in our efforts alone lies the pledge that we shall win that though we make certain temporary concessions necessitated by fatigue and famine we shall uphold the fundamental principles of our communist food policy and preserve them intact until the time comes when the victory of communism will be complete and worldwide I shall now read clause by clause the motion which the Communist group on the AllRussia Central Executive Committee submits for its considerationThis joint session of the AllRussia Central Executive Committee the AllRussia Trade Union Congress the Moscow Soviet and representatives of factory committees and trade unions of the city of Moscow hereby lays down the following fundamental principles of food policy and instructs the Peoples Commissariat of Food to draw up forthwith decrees embodying these principles1 The Soviet food policy is confirmed as correct and unassailable this policy consisting ina registration and state distribution on the class principleb monopoly of the principal foodstuffsc transfer of supply from private hands to state hands2 Unless the state monopoly of the chief items of food bread sugar tea and salt already decreed is strictly enforced and unless mass procurements of other of the more important foodstuffs meat seafish hemp sunflowerseed and linseed oil animal fats except butter and potatoes are made by the state at fixed prices it will be impossible to ensure a regular supply of food to the population under present conditions Furthermore such mass procurements at fixed prices are only a preliminary measure in preparation for a state monopoly of those foodstuffs too which will be the next task of the Food Commissariat to introduceThe procurement and transportation of all foodstuffs enumerated in this clause with the exception of potatoes are forbidden to all but the state food bodies The right to mass procurement of potatoes at the established fixed prices shall in addition to state bodies be granted also to workers organisations trade unions and cooperative societies3 As a temporary measure workers organisations and cooperative societies shall be granted the right to procure all foodstuffs other than those enumerated in Clause 24 The local food bodies are hereby compelled to assist the food procuring organisations in the exercise of this rightFrom the standpoint of old habits and the old idea of government the use of the word compelled may surprise you You may perhaps say Can things be so bad in the Soviet Republic that people have to be compelled to obey the will of the AllRussia Central Executive Committee Yes we have to compel and it is better to say so frankly than to hide our heads under our wing and pretend everything is going swimmingly Just let our comrades the representatives of the AllRussia Central Executive Committee and the delegates at the AllRussia Trade Union Congress give good thought to what they say among themselves Let them give a thought to whether they are properly carrying out everything decreed long ago concerning the proper registration of foodstuffs and the full delivery to the state of those foodstuffs which cannot be left for commodity exchange purposes When there is no commodity exchange the peasants say No youll get nothing from us for your Kerensky money If you give a thought to what you say in private among yourselves and bear in mind how many of the orders of the central authorities remain unfulfilled you must admit it is better to tell the truth and say that our local bodies have to be compelled firmly and ruthlessly Applause At this meeting in which the AllRussia Central Executive Committee as our supreme body has come together with the AllRussia Trade Union Congress bodies which have the most numerous representationand that just now is the main thingthese most influential comrades must firmly say and make it known in their localities that the local bodies must get accustomed to the idea that we have to compel them to carry out the policy of the central authorities consistently That is very difficult and it is natural that many millions of people who are accustomed to looking on the central authorities as robbers landowners exploiters can have no trust in the centre But this distrust must be overcome Socialism cannot be built if it is not for that means building a centralised economic system an economic system directed from the centre and that can only be done by the proletariat which has been trained in this spirit by the factory and by its whole mode of life Only the proletariat can do this The fight against parochial tendencies against the habits of the small propertyowner is a difficult one We know this cannot be done all at once but we shall never tire of urging the workers to reiterate this truth and put it into practice for socialism cannot be built otherwiseClause 4 explains furtherThe transportation and marketing of these foodstuffs shall be absolutely unrestricted No pickets cordons guards etc shall have the right to prevent the unrestricted transportation and sale of the said foodstuffs in bazaars or markets from carts etcThis point is particularly important Comrade Kamenev has mentioned many things here which naturally in the haste of our work we have not carried out our Food and other Commissariats have to issue one order on top of another with the result that our local bodies find it very difficult to get them all straight We are accused of issuing decrees too hastily but what are we to do when we have to make haste because of the advance of imperialism when we are compelled to make haste by the strongest scourge imaginablethe lack of bread and fuel This being so we must use every means to explain our tasks to elucidate particular mistakes and that is why the clear and precise demarcation now achieved by this struggle is so important To achieve this on a far larger scale we must now make sure that the local bodies do not act as if they are a law to themselves that they do not dare to plead they remembered yesterdays decree but forgot todays We must make sure they know quite clearly and definitely which foodstuffs are a state monopoly and which are open to unrestricted transportation and salethat is everything except what is specifically enumerated in clauses I and 2 Let this be made generally known Let those who are now about to return home convey it to the localities Let them do what their official position requires of them Let them take along with them copies of the decrees that will be drawn up on the subject so that these may be implicitly obeyed and carried out in the localities so that the orders of the centre may really be carried out and the former indecision stoppedFurther the end of Clause 4 readsNote With respect to eggs and butter this decision shall apply only to districts where mass procurements of eggs and butter are not made by the Food CommissariatComrades I am now going to read the remaining clauses of the decree in brief As I am unable to go into detail and as there is no need to do so since several other comrades some of them better qualified than myself will speak after me I shall only stress what I consider most important I shall read only the basic principles which we recommend the AllRussia Central Executive Committee to adopt and instruct the Council of Peoples Commissars and all other authorities of the Soviet Republic to embody in decrees and carry out unreservedly and implicitly Applause5 With a view to increasing procurements and to the more efficient performance of individual tasks the principle of surplus appropriation and procurement shall be extended to nonmonopoly foodstuffs and a bonus system introduced for cooperative and other organisations engaged in procuring both monopoly and nonmonopoly produce for the stateMeasures of organisation for introducing fresh forces into the food bodies and for the wider participation of workersa Workers food inspectors shall be widely utilised and their functions extended to include control over the way the December 10 decrees are observed by the food bodies and over the procurement of nonmonopoly foodstuffsb Worlcers inspection shall be introduced at the earliest possible date in all food bodies in the localities and extended to the Food Commissariat departments with the object of vigorously combating bureaucracy and red tapec Connections with the workers organisationstrade unions and workers cooperative societiesshall be strengthened by reinforcing the local bodies with active members of the aforesaid organisationsd A system of workers trainees shall be introduced in all central and local bodies and institutions in order to train workers as practical specialists in food affairs capable of filling responsible posts6 The cooperative apparatus shall be employed to the full in the work of procurement and distribution Responsible representatives of the state supply bodies shall be appointed to the cooperative societies to control the activities of the cooperative organisations and coordinate them with the governments food policyThat incidentally is one of the ways of fighting the top people in the cooperatives But it would be a great mistake and positively fatal to scorn the entire cooperative apparatus to reject it out of hand or in a contemptuous way saying We shall build ourselves a new one this is no business of ours this is something for Communists only We must make use of the machinery ready at handwe cannot build socialism unless we utilise what capitalism has left us We must utilise everything in the way of cultural values capitalism created against our interests Therein lies the difficulty of socialism that it has to be built of materials made by our adversaries but therein lies the only possibility for socialism We all know this theoretically and now that we have got over this year we have seen in practice that socialism can only be built from what capitalism has created against our interests and that we must employ all this to build and consolidate socialismClause 7 reads7 Supervision to ensure the proper observance of the regulations governing the transportation of foodstuffs and the strict enforcement of the monopolies shall devolve on the workers aided by armed detachments formed by the Food CommissariatAll food pickets other than the teams of the Food Commissariat and the Guberriia Food Committees shall be withdrawn immediately The teams of the Food Commissariat and the Gubernia Food Committees shall be withdrawn as and when the respective bodies of workers Inspectors are formed in the localitiesMy time is up comrades and I shall only point out that here in these last clauses we find the main principles underlying our food policy and Soviet policy in general I have already said that hard times have come that a more drastic six months has begun that the respite in food difficulties is over and a most difficult period has commenced Every time the Soviet government encounters difficulties in the extremely difficult job of building socialism it knows only one way to overcome them and that is to turn to the workers to wider and wider sections of the workers every time I have already said socialism can be built only when ten and a hundred times more people themselves begin to build the state and the new economic life Our food workers have as their reports show already got to a stage where no less than onethird of the members of the district food committees are workers chiefly workers from Petrograd Moscow and IvanovoVoznesenskthe flower of our proletarian army That is good but it is not enough What we need is twothirds and we must go on working for it As you know the advanced sections of the workers have already set about governing the state building a new life We know we must reach down deeper and more boldly enlist new sections They still lack training they will inevitably make mistakes but we are not afraid of that We know that in this way we shall get young trained workers and recompense errors a hundredfold by securing scores of younger and fresher forces There is no other source we can draw on We must move ahead all the time take our young workers from wherever we can and put them in more and more responsible postsThe present food crisis is due to the fact that a more difficult six months has begun It is also due to the state of transport As I have already said in the second half of 1918 we procured 67500000 poods But we were unable to get out 20000000 of this amount The latest severe crisis in Petrograd is due to the fact that our stocks are held up on the VolgaBugulma Railway and we cannot move them out The railways are in a desperate state The rolling stock is in a dreadful state because no country has suffered so badly as Russia owing to her prevailing backwardness and because the rail workers are not so well organised I would ask you on leaving this meeting to make the people aware of our need for numerous workers for food organisation and the railways who would help us with their experience Give them a job keep an eye on the novices and they will do a lot more than the old organisations Everybody on food and transport work Let every organisation no matter which branch it belongs to review all its forces and ask itself whether it has taken enough men whether it has done all it should in the way of sending commissars as we send them for the army The workers are suffering from lack of food We must put our best people on the job appoint them all to responsible military food or transport posts Everybody can be of use here even if he is not an expert On the railways it is sometimes the aid of a Party comrade that is required the influence of an ideologically staunch proletarian who has had his schooling and will influence the less proletarian sections of railway employees by control and supervision Comrades I once more repeat the slogan Everybody on food and transport work We must do what we did in the army where we sent our political commissars and achieved the tasks we set ourselves I am sure we shall this time too in these difficult six months conquer famine and devastationEndnotes1 The session was called because of the critica1 food situation It was held at the Bolshoi Theatre In his speech Lenin explained the draft of his theses of food policy which he submitted to the session on behalf of the Bolshevik group in the AllRussia Central Executive Committee The draft was unanimously approved The resolution recognised that it was correct to introduce a state monopoly of staple foodstuffs like grain tea salt and sugar The products whose monopolisation was recognised as untimely meat seafish etc were to be procured only by the Food Commissariats organs at fixed prices The basic propositions of the resolution were incorporated in the decree On the Procurement of Foostuffs which was endorsed by the Council of Peoples Commissars on January 21 1919 and published in Izvestia on January 24 These government measures formed part of a whole system of measures known as the policy of war communism2 The year 1861 saw the abolition of serfdom in Russia3 Lenin refers to the decision of the Moscow Soviet of August 24 1918 and the decision of the Petrograd Soviet of September 5 1918 which permitted workers of Moscow and Petrograd free carriage of foodstuffs in quantities up to 1 12 poods of personal consumption This measure was necessitated by the difficult food situation and adopted as an exception from the decision of the Council of Peoples Commissars on grain monopoly The Council of Peoples Commissars made these decisions effective until October 1 1918""",CheckYourFact,fake,1,103

of the brain responsible for personality behavior language and motor function The funding from NIHs National Institute on Aging NIA and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDS is expected to total more than 63 million over five years to advance the development of treatments for FTLDThe existing NIHsupported studies  Advancing Research and Treatment in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration ARTFL and Longitudinal Evaluation of Familial Frontotemporal Dementia Subjects LEFFTDS  together form the new ARTFLLEFFTDS Longitudinal Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration ALLFTD research consortium The overarching goal for the consortium is to prepare for clinical trials by helping researchers better understand the FTLD disease process by finding improved methods for accurately identifying participants with FTLD and for measuring disease progression Specifically the consortium aims to find the best biomarkers such as MRI neuroimaging to track disease burden and develop ways to calculate and predict risk of worsening symptomsThis unified approach is another example of collaborative NIH efforts meant to speed up discovery in a very challenging research area and make measurable progress against a devastating group of diseases said NIA Director Richard J Hodes MD The discoveries made in FTLD could also help with finding treatments for other dementias such as Alzheimers diseaseWhile Alzheimers disease is the most common dementia scientists think FTLD is the most common cause of dementia in people younger than age 60 Roughly 60 of people with FTLD are 45 to 64 years old and people as young as in their 30s can be affected There are no current treatments for FTLD which is the neuropathological definition for frontotemporal dementia FTDFTLD is associated with shrinking of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain and shares some characteristics of Alzheimers disease including misfolded proteins and loss of brain cells However the diseases that make up FTLD are distinct For example while Alzheimers is primarily associated with amyloid and tau proteins FTLD can be caused by another form of tau or the protein TDP43 While Alzheimers is characterized by problems in memory the range of symptoms of FTLD can include unusual behaviors emotional problems trouble communicating difficulty with work or difficulty with walkingWe are deeply aware of the large burden of these brain diseases on people as well as their families and caregivers and recognize the urgent need for therapies said NINDS Director Walter Koroshetz MD Key to this research is measuring and understanding how FTLD progresses so we can slow or stop itNow combined within the ALLFTD consortium the LEFFTDS study enrolls and follows individuals from families with a known genetic mutation causing FTD and the ARTFL study focuses on those without known mutations although some have strong family histories without one of the known FTD mutationsLed by researchers at the Mayo Clinic

923,1115,"""New tool that uses DNA sequencing could improve transplant outcomes and save livesResearchers have developed a simple blood test that can detect when a newly transplanted lung is being rejected by a patient even when no outward signs of the rejection are evident The test could make it possible for doctors to intervene faster to prevent or slow down socalled chronic rejectionwhich is severe irreversible and often deadlyin those first critical months after lung transplantation Researchers believe this same test might also be useful for monitoring rejection in other types of organ transplants The work was funded by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute NHLBI part of the National Institutes of HealthThe studys findings were published Jan 22 in EBioMedicine a publication of The LancetThis test solves a longstanding problem in lung transplants detection of hidden signs of rejection said Hannah Valantine MD coleader of the study and lead investigator of the Laboratory of Organ Transplant Genomics in the Cardiovascular Branch at NHLBI Were very excited about its potential to save lives especially in the wake of a critical shortage of donor organsThe test relies on DNA sequencing Valantine explained and as such represents a great example of personalized medicine as it will allow doctors to tailor transplant treatments to those individuals who are at highest risk for rejectionLung transplant recipients have the shortest survival rates among patients who get solid organ transplantation of any kindonly about half live past five years Lung transplant recipients face a high incidence of chronic rejection which occurs when the bodys immune system attacks the transplanted organ Existing tools for detecting signs of rejection such as biopsy either require the removal of small amounts of lung tissue or are not sensitive enough to discern the severity of the rejection The new test appears to overcome those challengesCalled the donorderived cellfree DNA test the experimental test begins with obtaining a few blood droplets taken from the arm of the transplant recipient A special set of machines then sorts the DNA fragments in the blood sample and in combination with computer analysis determines whether the fragments are from the recipient or the donor and how many of each type are present Because injured or dying cells from the donor release lots of donor DNA fragments into the bloodstream compared to normal donor cells higher amounts of donor DNA indicate a higher risk for transplant rejection in the recipientIn the study 106 lung transplant recipients were enrolled and monitored Blood samples collected in the first three months after transplantation underwent the testing procedure The results showed that those with higher levels of the donorderived DNA fragments in the first three months of transplantation were six times more likely to subsequently develop transplant organ failure or die during the study followup period than those with lower donorderived DNA levels Importantly researchers found that more than half of the highrisk subjects showed no outward signs of clinical complications during this period We showed for the first time that donorderived DNA is a predictive marker for chronic lung rejection and death and could provide critical timepoints to intervene perhaps preventing these outcomes Valantine said Once rejection is detected early via this test doctors would then have the option to increase the dosages of antirejection drugs add new agents that reduce tissue inflammation or take other measures to prevent or slow the progressionIn 2010 Valantine was part of a research team that pioneered the first blood test to diagnose organ rejection The nowwidely used test called the AlloMap analyzes the expression of 20 genes in a transplant recipients blood sample to determine whether the patients immune system is launching an attack The following year Valantine and her colleagues showed for the first time that a cellfree DNA blood test could be useful for monitoring early signs of rejection However those early studies of the cellfree DNA test only identified signs of acute transplant rejection which is easily reversed The current study shows that high cellfree DNA levels during the first three months after transplant predicts chronic rejection If validated this blood test could become a routine tool used to monitor transplant patients at very early stages of rejection the researchers saidThis research is supported by The Genomic Research Alliance for Transplantation Study NCT02423070 which is funded by the Division of Intramural Research of NHLBI The research is also supported by The Genome Transplant Dynamics Study NCT01985412 which is funded by the National Institute

1382,667,"""Dec 12 2022  Betsy E a 58yearold editor in Delaware was looking forward to seeing her 79yearold aunt for Thanksgiving It had been almost 3 years since they last saw each other because holiday plans had been canceled due to the COVID19 pandemic I had kept in touch with Aunt Vera by phone and she was conversational says Betsy who asked that her real name not be used for this article She always had a tendency to repeat herself so I didnt think much of it when she repeated the same stories as if I had never heard them But when Betsy arrived at her aunts she was shocked There was moldy food in the fridge A stack of dustcovered library books stood in the hallway some due over 6 months ago Usually Aunt Vera cooked a lavish Thanksgiving dinner but this year she said she didnt know what to cook and suggested going to a restaurant Monica Moreno the senior director of care and support at the Alzheimers Association says the holiday season is often a time when families come together It may also be a time when extended family members notice cognitive changes in a loved one they dont see regularly Even if you often talk by phone its not the same as seeing firsthand how the person is navigating daily life Moreno notes Two officials from Brightview Senior Living  an organization of 45 senior communities across the United States echo Moreno Patrick Doyle PhD vice president of hospitality services for Brightview and principal faculty at the Johns Hopkins Center for Innovative Care in Aging and Cole Smith corporate director of dementia care at Brightview say its important to acknowledge that each person has a different baseline for cognitive health and to use your knowledge of your relative to understand when their behavior is out of the norm for them For example some people seem to recall every name date and number theyve ever learned For them not remembering their grandchilds birthday would be exceptionally unusualShortterm memory declines with aging but people in the early stages of Alzheimers disease often experience memory loss to an extent that it begins to disrupt their daily life say Doyle and Smith The individual may be missing important events forgetting to take medications they have taken for many years or they may even be starting to mix up names and details about their friends and family Another common warning sign is that the person may have a hard time doing familiar tasks Often people with early stages of Alzheimers may get lost driving or walking to routine places they say None Recent traffic violations accidents or dents and damage to the car None Changes in financial habits for example missing bills None New problems with spoken or written words None Changes in mood or personality None A hard time following recipes or doing other complex tasks Dont dismiss your relatives symptoms Doyle and Smith urge There is a lot of fear associated with Alzheimers and this can cause people to try to rationalize the observed behavior as normal when it is a clear deviation from the persons norm Instead jump into action if youre concerned  although it can be a delicate subject so proceed with caution Use your knowledge of your relative to determine how they will likely respond when you broach the subject Some people experiencing cognitive decline are aware and will make statements about their own observations and concerns in that case offer your support and get a thorough clinical assessment they say Moreno also recommends talking to other family members before sharing concerns Ask if others are noticing the same signs you see Some family members may dismiss the changes saying theyre a part of normal aging and spouses may cover for one another she warnsWhen it comes to what to say be honest and compassionate Moreno advises Start by sharing some of the things youre seeing and asking if your loved one is also concerned Mom I noticed you were having a hard time making holiday cookies and Id like to talk to you about why that happened Youve been making them for years and its not like you Moreno recommends focusing on specifics and sharing them in a way you think the family member will be able to hear Let them know youve got their back And if your first attempt doesnt go as well as you would have liked take time to regroup You might try a different time of day or recruit someone else to talk to your loved one like another family member friend or trusted person from their faith community You can also share your concerns with the persons doctor Doyle and Smith note that some people living with dementia do not have an awareness of their deficits and may even be offended by the suggestion that something is wrong making a conversation about your concerns more challenging and delicate If you have a strong relationship with your relative you can leverage that connection by asking the person if they can do you a favor  share that you are concerned about their health and say it would make you feel more comfortable if they went with you to see a doctor And avoid coming across as accusatory or demanding People respond better to compassion care and support Doyle and Smith observe stressing that there is no one approach that works for everyone since every person is unique and family dynamics vary dramatically The Alzheimers Associations 247 hotline provides advice and guidance 8002723900 and its website offers conversation tips to help families navigate this delicate process As for Betsy after noticing her aunt was not herself she decided to contact her aunts son There had been some estrangement and my cousin hadnt seen my aunt for a long time But once he heard what was going on it motivated him to want to heal things with her go to the doctor with her and make a plan with her for her future so hes coming for Christmas""",WebMD,real,0,1382

1534,1074,"""Sept 27 2022  When feeling stressed people are more likely to focus on their romantic partners negative behaviors rather than their positive behaviors according to a published in Social Psychological and Personality Science Previous studies have shown that stressful life circumstances can affect how couples interact and influence their individual behaviors But this study suggests that stress can also affect what people notice in the first place such as their partner being annoying impatient or critical We found that individuals who reported experiencing more stressful life events outside of their relationship such as problems at work were especially likely to notice if their partner behaved in an inconsiderate manner Lisa Neff PhD the lead study author and an associate professor of human development and family sciences at the University of Texas at Austin said  Neff and colleagues did a daily diary study with 79 heterosexual newlywed couples to understand what they went through The couples completed a short survey each night for 10 days where they documented both their own and their partners behavior Before the study they also completed a questionnaire about the stressful events in their lifeThe research team found that those who recently had more stressful life events were particularly attuned to the daytoday changes in their partners negative behaviors  but not their partners positive behaviors They also generally perceived their partner as causing more negativity across the 10 days as compared with those who had fewer stressful events Studying newlyweds highlights the significance of the results Neff said because couples are more likely to focus on positive behavior and ignore negative behavior during the honeymoon period of their marriage One direction would be to examine if the harmful effects of stress might be even stronger among couples no longer in the newlywed phase of their relationships she said But the fact that we found these effects in a sample of newlyweds speaks to how impactful the effects of stress can be Importantly a single stressful day didnt appear to cause partners to focus on their significant others negative behavior the researchers found Instead a longer accumulation of stressful life circumstances often caused a shift in focusFor many people the past few years have been difficult and the stress of the pandemic continues to linger Neff said If stress focuses individuals attention toward their partners more inconsiderate behaviors this is likely to take a toll on the relationship More research could investigate whether its possible for couples to correct this behavior if theyre aware of the effects of stress in their lives she said""",WebMD,real,0,1534
