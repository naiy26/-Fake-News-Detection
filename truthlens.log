2025-04-09 21:38:41,221 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: New images have emerged of one of China¡¯s futuristic fighter jets, a three-engine, tailless flying wing aircraft that Western analysts have dubbed the J-36. It¡¯s unclear when the images, which are taken from a video, were shot, but they appeared on Chinese social media sites on Monday and show the aircraft flying over a highway near the runway of Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, the factory in Sichuan province where the new jet is believed to have been made. Images of the J-36 first appeared on Chinese social media late last year, quickly capturing the attention of aircraft enthusiasts and military analysts. More appeared online last month. The jet is thought to be a sixth-generation aircraft, incorporating the latest stealth technology, avionics and powerplant and airframe engineering. Military aviation expert David Cenciotti, a former Italian Air Force officer, said on his website, The Aviationist, that the six-second video gives a close look at the design of the J-36.

China to unveil J-35A stealth fighter jet as air force aims to match US aerial power ¡°The trijet engine arrangement, with two engine intakes under the wings and a dorsally-mounted intake behind the cockpit, is a departure from conventional twin-engine setups seen in many contemporary fighters. This configuration may offer advantages in terms of thrust and redundancy,¡± Cenciotti wrote. He said space on the aircraft¡¯s belly shows room for internal weapons bays that could enable it to carry long-range strike missiles. The J-36 could see China pull even with, or possibly ahead of, the United States in the race to field a sixth-generation fighter. The US military¡¯s fifth-generation jets ¨C the twin-engine F-22 and single-engine F-35 ¨C are generally regarded as the world¡¯s best at the moment, though China also has two fifth-generation models, the J-20 and J-35. Neither of those Chinese jets has proven combat experience and effectiveness like the two US fighters, however. US President Donald Trump announced last month that a contract for the US Air Force¡¯s sixth-generation fighter ¨C dubbed the F-47 ¨C had been awarded to Boeing. Trump said a prototype of the jet had been flying for five years. But a US Air Force announcement of the Boeing contract for the F-47 did not give a timeline for when the jets would be deployable, saying only the contract awarded on March 21 covered ¡°the engineering and manufacturing development phase¡± as well as funds for ¡°a small number of test aircraft for evaluation.¡± While China¡¯s J-36 was dominating military aviation chatter this week, it¡¯s not the only sixth-generation jet that Beijing seems to have in the works.

The People¡¯s Liberation Army (PLA) hasn¡¯t publicly acknowledged the existence of either the J-36 or J-50. But the state-run tabloid Global Times last month ran a story quoting various Chinese military experts as saying the images of the two new aircraft ¡°if authentic,¡± show China is making quick progress on sixth-generation fighter jets. ¡°From a development point of view, China appears to be determined to make explorations on next-generation aviation equipment,¡± Wang Ya¡¯nan, chief editor of Aerospace Knowledge magazine, was quoted as saying. It can take years for a fighter jet to go from concept to public introduction, let alone deployment. China¡¯s J-35 was first shown to the public at last November¡¯s Airshow China in Zuhai, but it had been in development for 10 or more years, according to analysts.

2025-04-09 22:39:18,588 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: America¡¯s largest military shipbuilder has signed a deal with a South Korean company that experts say could be a big step in helping the US Navy build new warships to keep pace with rival China in fleet size. Virginia-based HII (Huntington Ingalls Industries) and South Korea¡¯s Hyundai Heavy Industries inked the memorandum of understanding (MOU) on Monday at a defense exhibition in Maryland. ¡°Today¡¯s agreement reflects our commitment to explore all opportunities to expand US shipbuilding capacity in support of national security,¡± HII Executive Vice President Brian Blanchette said at a ceremony at the Sea Air Space 2025 exposition. ¡°By working with our shipbuilding allies and sharing best practices, we believe this MOU offers real potential to help accelerate delivery of quality ships.¡± A Hyundai Heavy Industries statement noted that both HII and the South Korean shipyard build Aegis destroyers, the backbones of the US and South Korean surface fleets. Aegis ships provide protection against missile threats, including powerful ballistic missiles in the arsenals of rivals China and North Korea. ¡°This MOU is particularly significant as it marks the first collaboration between two leading shipbuilding companies from Korea and the US, both of which have the capability to construct the world¡¯s most advanced Aegis ships,¡± the statement said. Hyundai Heavy Industries operates the world¡¯s largest shipyard in Ulsan, South Korea, and it builds 10% of the world¡¯s ships, according to the company¡¯s website. Analysts have long called for the US to take steps with allies like South Korea and Japan to cooperate on naval shipbuilding as Chinese shipyards have been churning out warships at breakneck speed, giving the People¡¯s Liberation Army Navy the world¡¯s largest fleet. Meanwhile, Washington has failed to keep pace, due in large part to limited capacity in shipyard space and insufficient workers in the US. ¡°This agreement is a strong start towards alleviating the impact of America¡¯s shortfall in shipbuilding capacity,¡± said Hawaii-based analyst Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain. Schuster said while changes would be needed to US law to enable the South Korean shipyard to begin fully constructing destroyers for the US Navy, the pact signed Monday could yield immediate benefits. ¡°(US) law does not prohibit using foreign yards to repair and do maintenance on US Navy ships, and we have a 36-month backlog on shipyard maintenance and hull refurbishment,¡± he said. Another South Korean shipyard, Hanwha Ocean, last month completed a seven-month overhaul of a US Military Sealift Command supply ship, the USNS Wally Schirra, a feat a US Navy admiral called a ¡°landmark achievement.¡± ¡°Maintenance in Theater reduces downtime and costs, while enhancing operational readiness,¡± Rear Adm. Neil Koprowski, commander of US Naval Forces Korea, said in a statement. But cooperation between the builders of Aegis destroyers takes the alliance to a higher level. Related article

South Korean lawmaker Yu Yong-weon called the deal ¡°a new win-win model of shipbuilding and defense industry cooperation between South Korea and the United States.¡± ¡°With Korean shipyards directly participating in the enhancement of US naval power, it is also expected to contribute to ROK-US security cooperation, including efforts to keep China in check,¡± Yu said. ROK stands for Republic of Korea. Schuster sees another big benefit from the deal. ¡°Hyundai and Huntington can use the agreement to train new American workers for HII¡¯s shipyards. A labor shortage is the primary limiting factor in America¡¯s shipyard capacity,¡± he said. If it can eventually be worked out that warships for the US Navy could be built in South Korea, the impact could be even more substantial. Woo-man Jeong, Hyundai Heavy¡¯s specialized ship business division managing director, told South Korea¡¯s Chosun Ilbo newspaper last month that his company could build five or more Aegis destroyers a year. US shipyards average two or fewer destroyers built per year. The HII-Hyundai deal follows a big investment in US-based shipbuilding last year by Hanwha Ocean, when it purchased Philly Shipyard, which builds mainly commercial vessels but also does maintenance and repair work on government vessels. Bence Nemeth, a senior lecturer at King¡¯s College London, said after the Philly Shipyard deal that US-South Korea shipbuilding cooperation benefits the security of both countries. ¡°In the short term, the US Navy will benefit from increased availability of ships, and in the medium term, it could accelerate the growth of its fleet. This can help Washington maintain its global maritime dominance,¡± Nemeth wrote on the Korea Institute for Maritime Strategy¡¯s website. ¡°A strong U.S. Navy is also crucial for South Korean national security, as it helps deter North Korean aggression,¡± Nemeth said.

Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman co-founded OpenAI in 2015, but Musk left before the company became a technology star. Recently Musk, who went on to create his own AI firm, xAI, in 2023, has tried to prevent the ChatGPT maker from transitioning to a for-profit model, culminating in the current court case.

2025-04-10 17:37:58,626 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: America¡¯s largest military shipbuilder has signed a deal with a South Korean company that experts say could be a big step in helping the US Navy build new warships to keep pace with rival China in fleet size. Virginia-based HII (Huntington Ingalls Industries) and South Korea¡¯s Hyundai Heavy Industries inked the memorandum of understanding (MOU) on Monday at a defense exhibition in Maryland. ¡°Today¡¯s agreement reflects our commitment to explore all opportunities to expand US shipbuilding capacity in support of national security,¡± HII Executive Vice President Brian Blanchette said at a ceremony at the Sea Air Space 2025 exposition. ¡°By working with our shipbuilding allies and sharing best practices, we believe this MOU offers real potential to help accelerate delivery of quality ships.¡± A Hyundai Heavy Industries statement noted that both HII and the South Korean shipyard build Aegis destroyers, the backbones of the US and South Korean surface fleets. Aegis ships provide protection against missile threats, including powerful ballistic missiles in the arsenals of rivals China and North Korea. ¡°This MOU is particularly significant as it marks the first collaboration between two leading shipbuilding companies from Korea and the US, both of which have the capability to construct the world¡¯s most advanced Aegis ships,¡± the statement said. Hyundai Heavy Industries operates the world¡¯s largest shipyard in Ulsan, South Korea, and it builds 10% of the world¡¯s ships, according to the company¡¯s website. Analysts have long called for the US to take steps with allies like South Korea and Japan to cooperate on naval shipbuilding as Chinese shipyards have been churning out warships at breakneck speed, giving the People¡¯s Liberation Army Navy the world¡¯s largest fleet. Meanwhile, Washington has failed to keep pace, due in large part to limited capacity in shipyard space and insufficient workers in the US. ¡°This agreement is a strong start towards alleviating the impact of America¡¯s shortfall in shipbuilding capacity,¡± said Hawaii-based analyst Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain. Schuster said while changes would be needed to US law to enable the South Korean shipyard to begin fully constructing destroyers for the US Navy, the pact signed Monday could yield immediate benefits. ¡°(US) law does not prohibit using foreign yards to repair and do maintenance on US Navy ships, and we have a 36-month backlog on shipyard maintenance and hull refurbishment,¡± he said. Another South Korean shipyard, Hanwha Ocean, last month completed a seven-month overhaul of a US Military Sealift Command supply ship, the USNS Wally Schirra, a feat a US Navy admiral called a ¡°landmark achievement.¡± ¡°Maintenance in Theater reduces downtime and costs, while enhancing operational readiness,¡± Rear Adm. Neil Koprowski, commander of US Naval Forces Korea, said in a statement. But cooperation between the builders of Aegis destroyers takes the alliance to a higher level. Related article
These may be the world¡¯s best warships. And they¡¯re not American ¡°We aim to enhance the shipbuilding capacities and capabilities of both nations and, furthermore, to contribute to the strengthening of bilateral security cooperation,¡± said Joo Wonho, chief executive of naval and special shipbuilding at Hyundai Heavy, in a statement. South Korean lawmaker Yu Yong-weon called the deal ¡°a new win-win model of shipbuilding and defense industry cooperation between South Korea and the United States.¡± ¡°With Korean shipyards directly participating in the enhancement of US naval power, it is also expected to contribute to ROK-US security cooperation, including efforts to keep China in check,¡± Yu said. ROK stands for Republic of Korea. Schuster sees another big benefit from the deal. ¡°Hyundai and Huntington can use the agreement to train new American workers for HII¡¯s shipyards. A labor shortage is the primary limiting factor in America¡¯s shipyard capacity,¡± he said. If it can eventually be worked out that warships for the US Navy could be built in South Korea, the impact could be even more substantial. Woo-man Jeong, Hyundai Heavy¡¯s specialized ship business division managing director, told South Korea¡¯s Chosun Ilbo newspaper last month that his company could build five or more Aegis destroyers a year. US shipyards average two or fewer destroyers built per year. The HII-Hyundai deal follows a big investment in US-based shipbuilding last year by Hanwha Ocean, when it purchased Philly Shipyard, which builds mainly commercial vessels but also does maintenance and repair work on government vessels. Bence Nemeth, a senior lecturer at King¡¯s College London, said after the Philly Shipyard deal that US-South Korea shipbuilding cooperation benefits the security of both countries. ¡°In the short term, the US Navy will benefit from increased availability of ships, and in the medium term, it could accelerate the growth of its fleet. This can help Washington maintain its global maritime dominance,¡± Nemeth wrote on the Korea Institute for Maritime Strategy¡¯s website. ¡°A strong U.S. Navy is also crucial for South Korean national security, as it helps deter North Korean aggression,¡± Nemeth said. CNN¡¯s Gawon Bae contributed to this report.

Schuster said while changes would be needed to US law to enable the South Korean shipyard to begin fully constructing destroyers for the US Navy, the pact signed Monday could yield immediate benefits. ¡°(US) law does not prohibit using foreign yards to repair and do maintenance on US Navy ships, and we have a 36-month backlog on shipyard maintenance and hull refurbishment,¡± he said. Another South Korean shipyard, Hanwha Ocean, last month completed a seven-month overhaul of a US Military Sealift Command supply ship, the USNS Wally Schirra, a feat a US Navy admiral called a ¡°landmark achievement.¡± ¡°Maintenance in Theater reduces downtime and costs, while enhancing operational readiness,¡± Rear Adm. Neil Koprowski, commander of US Naval Forces Korea, said in a statement. But cooperation between the builders of Aegis destroyers takes the alliance to a higher level. Related article
These may be the world¡¯s best warships. And they¡¯re not American ¡°We aim to enhance the shipbuilding capacities and capabilities of both nations and, furthermore, to contribute to the strengthening of bilateral security cooperation,¡± said Joo Wonho, chief executive of naval and special shipbuilding at Hyundai Heavy, in a statement. South Korean lawmaker Yu Yong-weon called the deal ¡°a new win-win model of shipbuilding and defense industry cooperation between South Korea and the United States.¡± ¡°With Korean shipyards directly participating in the enhancement of US naval power, it is also expected to contribute to ROK-US security cooperation, including efforts to keep China in check,¡± Yu said. ROK stands for Republic of Korea. Schuster sees another big benefit from the deal. ¡°Hyundai and Huntington can use the agreement to train new American workers for HII¡¯s shipyards. A labor shortage is the primary limiting factor in America¡¯s shipyard capacity,¡± he said. If it can eventually be worked out that warships for the US Navy could be built in South Korea, the impact could be even more substantial. Woo-man Jeong, Hyundai Heavy¡¯s specialized ship business division managing director, told South Korea¡¯s Chosun Ilbo newspaper last month that his company could build five or more Aegis destroyers a year. US shipyards average two or fewer destroyers built per year. The HII-Hyundai deal follows a big investment in US-based shipbuilding last year by Hanwha Ocean, when it purchased Philly Shipyard, which builds mainly commercial vessels but also does maintenance and repair work on government vessels. Bence Nemeth, a senior lecturer at King¡¯s College London, said after the Philly Shipyard deal that US-South Korea shipbuilding cooperation benefits the security of both countries. ¡°In the short term, the US Navy will benefit from increased availability of ships, and in the medium term, it could accelerate the growth of its fleet. This can help Washington maintain its global maritime dominance,¡± Nemeth wrote on the Korea Institute for Maritime Strategy¡¯s website. ¡°A strong U.S. Navy is also crucial for South Korean national security, as it helps deter North Korean aggression,¡± Nemeth said.

2025-04-10 19:33:04,096 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: America¡¯s largest military shipbuilder has signed a deal with a South Korean company that experts say could be a big step in helping the US Navy build new warships to keep pace with rival China in fleet size. Virginia-based HII (Huntington Ingalls Industries) and South Korea¡¯s Hyundai Heavy Industries inked the memorandum of understanding (MOU) on Monday at a defense exhibition in Maryland. ¡°Today¡¯s agreement reflects our commitment to explore all opportunities to expand US shipbuilding capacity in support of national security,¡± HII Executive Vice President Brian Blanchette said at a ceremony at the Sea Air Space 2025 exposition. ¡°By working with our shipbuilding allies and sharing best practices, we believe this MOU offers real potential to help accelerate delivery of quality ships.¡± A Hyundai Heavy Industries statement noted that both HII and the South Korean shipyard build Aegis destroyers, the backbones of the US and South Korean surface fleets. Aegis ships provide protection against missile threats, including powerful ballistic missiles in the arsenals of rivals China and North Korea. ¡°This MOU is particularly significant as it marks the first collaboration between two leading shipbuilding companies from Korea and the US, both of which have the capability to construct the world¡¯s most advanced Aegis ships,¡± the statement said.

Virginia-based HII (Huntington Ingalls Industries) and South Korea¡¯s Hyundai Heavy Industries inked the memorandum of understanding (MOU) on Monday at a defense exhibition in Maryland. ¡°Today¡¯s agreement reflects our commitment to explore all opportunities to expand US shipbuilding capacity in support of national security,¡± HII Executive Vice President Brian Blanchette said at a ceremony at the Sea Air Space 2025 exposition. ¡°By working with our shipbuilding allies and sharing best practices, we believe this MOU offers real potential to help accelerate delivery of quality ships.¡± A Hyundai Heavy Industries statement noted that both HII and the South Korean shipyard build Aegis destroyers, the backbones of the US and South Korean surface fleets. Aegis ships provide protection against missile threats, including powerful ballistic missiles in the arsenals of rivals China and North Korea. ¡°This MOU is particularly significant as it marks the first collaboration between two leading shipbuilding companies from Korea and the US, both of which have the capability to construct the world¡¯s most advanced Aegis ships,¡± the statement said. Hyundai Heavy Industries operates the world¡¯s largest shipyard in Ulsan, South Korea, and it builds 10% of the world¡¯s ships, according to the company¡¯s website. Analysts have long called for the US to take steps with allies like South Korea and Japan to cooperate on naval shipbuilding as Chinese shipyards have been churning out warships at breakneck speed, giving the People¡¯s Liberation Army Navy the world¡¯s largest fleet. Meanwhile, Washington has failed to keep pace, due in large part to limited capacity in shipyard space and insufficient workers in the US. ¡°This agreement is a strong start towards alleviating the impact of America¡¯s shortfall in shipbuilding capacity,¡± said Hawaii-based analyst Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain. Schuster said while changes would be needed to US law to enable the South Korean shipyard to begin fully constructing destroyers for the US Navy, the pact signed Monday could yield immediate benefits. ¡°(US) law does not prohibit using foreign yards to repair and do maintenance on US Navy ships, and we have a 36-month backlog on shipyard maintenance and hull refurbishment,¡± he said. Another South Korean shipyard, Hanwha Ocean, last month completed a seven-month overhaul of a US Military Sealift Command supply ship, the USNS Wally Schirra, a feat a US Navy admiral called a ¡°landmark achievement.¡± ¡°Maintenance in Theater reduces downtime and costs, while enhancing operational readiness,¡± Rear Adm. Neil Koprowski, commander of US Naval Forces Korea, said in a statement. But cooperation between the builders of Aegis destroyers takes the alliance to a higher level. Related article
These may be the world¡¯s best warships. And they¡¯re not American ¡°We aim to enhance the shipbuilding capacities and capabilities of both nations and, furthermore, to contribute to the strengthening of bilateral security cooperation,¡± said Joo Wonho, chief executive of naval and special shipbuilding at Hyundai Heavy, in a statement. South Korean lawmaker Yu Yong-weon called the deal ¡°a new win-win model of shipbuilding and defense industry cooperation between South Korea and the United States.¡± ¡°With Korean shipyards directly participating in the enhancement of US naval power, it is also expected to contribute to ROK-US security cooperation, including efforts to keep China in check,¡± Yu said. ROK stands for Republic of Korea. Schuster sees another big benefit from the deal. ¡°Hyundai and Huntington can use the agreement to train new American workers for HII¡¯s shipyards. A labor shortage is the primary limiting factor in America¡¯s shipyard capacity,¡± he said. If it can eventually be worked out that warships for the US Navy could be built in South Korea, the impact could be even more substantial. Woo-man Jeong, Hyundai Heavy¡¯s specialized ship business division managing director, told South Korea¡¯s Chosun Ilbo newspaper last month that his company could build five or more Aegis destroyers a year. US shipyards average two or fewer destroyers built per year. The HII-Hyundai deal follows a big investment in US-based shipbuilding last year by Hanwha Ocean, when it purchased Philly Shipyard, which builds mainly commercial vessels but also does maintenance and repair work on government vessels. Bence Nemeth, a senior lecturer at King¡¯s College London, said after the Philly Shipyard deal that US-South Korea shipbuilding cooperation benefits the security of both countries. ¡°In the short term, the US Navy will benefit from increased availability of ships, and in the medium term, it could accelerate the growth of its fleet. This can help Washington maintain its global maritime dominance,¡± Nemeth wrote on the Korea Institute for Maritime Strategy¡¯s website. ¡°A strong U.S. Navy is also crucial for South Korean national security, as it helps deter North Korean aggression,¡± Nemeth said. CNN¡¯s Gawon Bae contributed to this report.

2025-04-11 20:13:07,677 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: America¡¯s largest military shipbuilder has signed a deal with a South Korean company that experts say could be a big step in helping the US Navy build new warships to keep pace with rival China in fleet size. Virginia-based HII (Huntington Ingalls Industries) and South Korea¡¯s Hyundai Heavy Industries inked the memorandum of understanding (MOU) on Monday at a defense exhibition in Maryland. ¡°Today¡¯s agreement reflects our commitment to explore all opportunities to expand US shipbuilding capacity in support of national security,¡± HII Executive Vice President Brian Blanchette said at a ceremony at the Sea Air Space 2025 exposition. ¡°By working with our shipbuilding allies and sharing best practices, we believe this MOU offers real potential to help accelerate delivery of quality ships.¡± A Hyundai Heavy Industries statement noted that both HII and the South Korean shipyard build Aegis destroyers, the backbones of the US and South Korean surface fleets. Aegis ships provide protection against missile threats, including powerful ballistic missiles in the arsenals of rivals China and North Korea. ¡°This MOU is particularly significant as it marks the first collaboration between two leading shipbuilding companies from Korea and the US, both of which have the capability to construct the world¡¯s most advanced Aegis ships,¡± the statement said. Hyundai Heavy Industries operates the world¡¯s largest shipyard in Ulsan, South Korea, and it builds 10% of the world¡¯s ships, according to the company¡¯s website. Analysts have long called for the US to take steps with allies like South Korea and Japan to cooperate on naval shipbuilding as Chinese shipyards have been churning out warships at breakneck speed, giving the People¡¯s Liberation Army Navy the world¡¯s largest fleet. Meanwhile, Washington has failed to keep pace, due in large part to limited capacity in shipyard space and insufficient workers in the US. ¡°This agreement is a strong start towards alleviating the impact of America¡¯s shortfall in shipbuilding capacity,¡± said Hawaii-based analyst Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain. Schuster said while changes would be needed to US law to enable the South Korean shipyard to begin fully constructing destroyers for the US Navy, the pact signed Monday could yield immediate benefits. ¡°(US) law does not prohibit using foreign yards to repair and do maintenance on US Navy ships, and we have a 36-month backlog on shipyard maintenance and hull refurbishment,¡± he said. Another South Korean shipyard, Hanwha Ocean, last month completed a seven-month overhaul of a US Military Sealift Command supply ship, the USNS Wally Schirra, a feat a US Navy admiral called a ¡°landmark achievement.¡± ¡°Maintenance in Theater reduces downtime and costs, while enhancing operational readiness,¡± Rear Adm. Neil Koprowski, commander of US Naval Forces Korea, said in a statement. But cooperation between the builders of Aegis destroyers takes the alliance to a higher level. Related article
These may be the world¡¯s best warships. And they¡¯re not American ¡°We aim to enhance the shipbuilding capacities and capabilities of both nations and, furthermore, to contribute to the strengthening of bilateral security cooperation,¡± said Joo Wonho, chief executive of naval and special shipbuilding at Hyundai Heavy, in a statement. South Korean lawmaker Yu Yong-weon called the deal ¡°a new win-win model of shipbuilding and defense industry cooperation between South Korea and the United States.¡± ¡°With Korean shipyards directly participating in the enhancement of US naval power, it is also expected to contribute to ROK-US security cooperation, including efforts to keep China in check,¡± Yu said. ROK stands for Republic of Korea. Schuster sees another big benefit from the deal. ¡°Hyundai and Huntington can use the agreement to train new American workers for HII¡¯s shipyards. A labor shortage is the primary limiting factor in America¡¯s shipyard capacity,¡± he said. If it can eventually be worked out that warships for the US Navy could be built in South Korea, the impact could be even more substantial. Woo-man Jeong, Hyundai Heavy¡¯s specialized ship business division managing director, told South Korea¡¯s Chosun Ilbo newspaper last month that his company could build five or more Aegis destroyers a year. US shipyards average two or fewer destroyers built per year. The HII-Hyundai deal follows a big investment in US-based shipbuilding last year by Hanwha Ocean, when it purchased Philly Shipyard, which builds mainly commercial vessels but also does maintenance and repair work on government vessels. Bence Nemeth, a senior lecturer at King¡¯s College London, said after the Philly Shipyard deal that US-South Korea shipbuilding cooperation benefits the security of both countries. ¡°In the short term, the US Navy will benefit from increased availability of ships, and in the medium term, it could accelerate the growth of its fleet. This can help Washington maintain its global maritime dominance,¡± Nemeth wrote on the Korea Institute for Maritime Strategy¡¯s website. ¡°A strong U.S. Navy is also crucial for South Korean national security, as it helps deter North Korean aggression,¡± Nemeth said.

2025-04-11 20:41:46,271 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: A family¡¯s afternoon sightseeing excursion above the misty shoreline of Manhattan ended in tragedy Thursday after the helicopter carrying them crashed off the New Jersey shoreline, killing them and the pilot. Spectators watched the helicopter as it dropped from the sky and slammed into the river upside down as fluttering debris landed in the water. The victims included Agust¨ªn Escobar, a Siemens executive, and his family, according to a law enforcement official. The family was visiting from Spain, New York Mayor Eric Adams said during a news conference Thursday. CNN has reached out to the New York Police Department and the US Coast Guard for more information on the victims. While not much is known about why the helicopter crashed, its staggering descent from the sky shocked witnesses as first responders did what they could to rescue the victims. At 3:17 p.m., multiple 911 calls reported a helicopter crash in the Hudson River near the New Jersey coastline at Pier A Park in Hoboken, New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. When first responders arrived, police pulled four people out of the water and FDNY pulled out two people, she said. Four victims were declared dead on scene and an additional two people were taken to local hospitals, Tisch said. Two children were taken to the Jersey City Medical Center before being pronounced dead, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said on X. ¡°Our hearts go out to the family of those who were on board,¡± Adams said. President Donald Trump also sent his condolences via a Truth Social post, saying ¡°God bless the families and friends of the victims¡± and that Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy was looking into the incident. The helicopter, operated by the tour company New York Helicopter Charter, is currently submerged in the river. ¡°The only thing I can tell you is that we are devastated,¡± Michael Roth, the CEO of New York Helicopter Charter Inc., told CNN Thursday evening. ¡°I¡¯m a father, a grandfather and my wife hasn¡¯t stopped crying since this afternoon,¡± he added. When asked about the maintenance of the helicopter, Roth said, ¡°It¡¯s my director of maintenance who deals with that.¡± The company¡¯s director of maintenance declined to comment. Maintenance records are not public and the NTSB limits what companies can say publicly during an investigation. Spain¡¯s Prime Minister, Pedro S¨¢nchez, called the incident ¡°an unimaginable tragedy¡± in a post on X. ¡°I share in the grief of the victims¡¯ loved ones at this heartbreaking time,¡± he said. FlightRadar24 reported the aircraft to be a Bell 206L-4 LongRanger IV, based on ADS-B tracking data. It was built in 2004 and had an airworthiness certificate issued in 2016 that was good until 2029, according to Federal Aviation Administration records. There was no information immediately available on the pilot, according to Adams. The helicopter took off from the downtown Manhattan heliport at 2:59 p.m., where it flew south before turning to fly north along the Manhattan shoreline, up the Hudson River, Tisch said. At 3:08 p.m., the helicopter reached the George Washington Bridge and then turned to fly south along the New Jersey shoreline, where shortly after it lost control, she said. When the helicopter hit the water, officials believe it was inverted, leaving the cabin visible in the water, Tisch said. Reports that the helicopter stopped in mid-air and pieces of the helicopter were falling off before it hit the water is consistent with 911 reports, she said. The cause of the crash is under investigation, she said. The helicopter flew for about 16 minutes before going down into the water, according to analysis by CNN and flight tracking site FlightRadar 24. The flight path reflects much of what officials said, showing the aircraft took off from lower Manhattan and did a circle near the Statue of Liberty before flying up the Hudson River to the George Washington Bridge at about 1000 feet. At that point it turned back south, ultimately coming to rest in the water near New Jersey. The path up the Hudson is a popular sightseeing route. When the helicopter crashed, it was cloudy with winds around 10 to 15 mph with gusts up to 25 mph according to various weather reports in the area. Visibility at the surface was good ¡ª 10 miles ¡ª but it was cloudy as a system is moving into the region, bringing light rain to the region this afternoon and evening. Helicopters on an air traffic control frequency were asked to look for anyone in the water following the crash. ¡°Please keep your eyes open. You guys see anything in the water, please let us know,¡± said an emergency response pilot on the frequency. The FAA is temporarily prohibiting drone pilots from flying near today¡¯s helicopter crash unless they have specific authorization. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed it is investigating the situation alongside the National Transportation Safety Board. The NTSB is leading the investigation and will provide updates. The helicopter was in the Special Flight Rules Area in New York, where no air traffic control services are provided, Secretary Duffy said in a post on X Thursday. Several minutes before entering that area, air traffic control from LaGuardia Airport was providing support, he said. The National Transportation Safety Board chair and investigators are on their way to the site of today¡¯s deadly helicopter crash in the Hudson River. ¡°The NTSB is launching a go-team to investigate Thursday¡¯s crash of a Bell 206 L-4 helicopter near Jersey City, New Jersey,¡± the Board said in a social media post. ¡°The team is expected to arrive tonight.¡± The cause of the crash is under investigation by the NTSB, which will pore over documentation on all the work that had been done on the aircraft. That would include the company¡¯s compliance with two recent Federal Aviation Administration issued airworthiness directives. One directive from May 2023 required the testing and possible replacement of tail rotor drive shafts on eight different Bell 206L models, including the 206L-4. That directive was prompted by an incident in which a Bell 206L helicopter experienced the loss of a tail-rotor drive due to a joint failure. The FAA also issued a December 2022 airworthiness directive on Bell 206L models with specific parts, requiring inspection and possible replacement of the helicopters¡¯ main rotor blades because of ¡°delamination.¡± That refers to layers within the blade separating due to material fatigue, damage (from bird strikes, for example), or manufacturing errors, potentially leading the rotor blade to fail. The helicopter that crashed in the Hudson River was built in 2004 and had an airworthiness certificate issued in 2016 that was valid until 2029, according to FAA records. The company operating the helicopter was previously involved in two safety incidents investigated by federal aviation authorities. In 2015, a pilot for the New York Helicopter Charter company was forced to land in New Jersey after hovering 20 feet in the air for a short time. An initial inspection showed there ¡°may have been corrosion removed¡± from sections of the helicopter and that some of the helicopter¡¯s component parts may have been deformed to an extent to be ¡°considered unairworthy,¡± according to an FAA inspector at the time. The same helicopter was previously involved in a crash in Chile in 2010. In 2013, a pilot for the company was forced to land a helicopter carrying four passengers on the water near Manhattan after hearing a ¡°bang¡± that was followed by the ¡°Engine Out warning horn.¡± The pilot inflated the helicopter¡¯s floats and got the passengers to safety on an approaching boat. This story has been updated with additional information. CNN¡¯s Mark Morales, Alexandra Skores, Matt Stiles and Audrey Ash contributed to this report.

The high court said that the administration must try to return Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national who was deported on March 15. It said part of the lower court¡¯s order requiring the government to ¡°effectuate¡± his return was unclear and needed further review. The court did not give the administration a deadline for when Abrego Garcia should be returned. The opinion was unsigned and no dissents were noted. ¡°Tonight, the rule of law prevailed. The Supreme Court upheld the District Judge¡¯s order that the government has to bring Kilmar home,¡± said Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Abrego Garcia¡¯s attorneys. ¡°Now they need to stop wasting time and get moving.¡± But the Trump administration also framed the decision as a win for its position. ¡°As the Supreme Court correctly recognized, it is the exclusive prerogative of the president to conduct foreign affairs,¡± a Department of Justice spokesperson said. ¡°By directly noting the deference owed to the executive branch, this ruling once again illustrates that activist judges do not have the jurisdiction to seize control of the president¡¯s authority to conduct foreign policy.¡± The high court¡¯s unsigned and brief decision left US District Judge Paula Xinis¡¯ order in place but drew a distinction between ¡°facilitating¡± Abrego Garcia¡¯s return and ¡°effectuating¡± it. The lower court properly required the government to ¡°facilitate¡± his return, the justices made clear. ¡°The intended scope of the term ¡®effectuate¡¯ in the District Court¡¯s order is, however, unclear, and may exceed the District Court¡¯s authority,¡± the court wrote Thursday. Therefore, the court said, Xinis should ¡°clarify its directive, with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs.¡± That appeared to be a nod to the Trump administration¡¯s arguments in the case. In written briefs, the Trump administration had warned that requiring it to ¡°effectuate¡± the return of Abrego Garcia would violate separation of powers principles. And it defined ¡°facilitate¡± narrowly in those briefs ¨C essentially, removing any barriers to his return. Ultimately, the majority left it to the lower court to sort out how to strike the balance.

Supreme Court says Trump doesn¡¯t have to rehire independent labor board members for now ¡°Although the ruling makes clear that the district court can order the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia¡¯s return to the United States, it is maddeningly vague about exactly how it¡¯s supposed to do so,¡± said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center. ¡°For instance, if the judge asks the government about the specific arrangements it¡¯s made with the Salvadoran government and the government invokes the state secrets privilege, what happens then?¡± Vladeck added. ¡°It is, yet again, punting in a context in which the government can take advantage of the punt ¨C a loss for Trump on the big question, but a loss for Abrego Garc¨ªa on what matters most.¡± ¡°The Supreme Court¡¯s opinion today gives the administration cover to ¡®try¡¯ to bring him home but does not require the federal government ¨C the executive branch ¨C to bring Mr. Abrego Garcia home,¡± Elora Mukherjee, director of the Immigrants¡¯ Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School, told CNN. ¡°It¡¯s a decision that doesn¡¯t protect Mr. Abrego Garcia to the fullest extent that the law should.¡± Xinis on Thursday night ordered the Trump administration to ¡°take all available steps to facilitate¡± the return of Abrego Garcia, hours after the Supreme Court¡¯s order. The lower court judge also ordered lawyers for the Justice Department to provide her with a sworn statement by 9:30 a.m. ET Friday from an individual ¡°with personal knowledge¡± of the steps the government has or is planning to take to secure Abrego Garcia¡¯s return. Xinis scheduled a hearing over the issue for Friday afternoon. The court¡¯s three liberals didn¡¯t dissent from the decision but wrote separately to argue that the Trump administration¡¯s emergency appeal should have been denied in full. Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed the administration to existing executive branch policy that the federal government should ¡°facilitate [an] alien¡¯s return to the United States if ¡­ the alien¡¯s presence is necessary for continued administrative removal proceedings.¡± Sotomayor¡¯s statement criticized the Trump administration for dismissing the mistaken removal as an ¡°oversight,¡± rather than ¡°hastening to correct its egregious error.¡± ¡°The Government now requests an order from this Court permitting it to leave Abrego Garcia, a husband and father without a criminal record, in a Salvadoran prison for no reason recognized by the law,¡± she and the other liberals said. ¡°The only argument the Government offers in support of its request, that United States courts cannot grant relief once a deportee crosses the border, is plainly wrong.¡± Sotomayor said that when the proceedings go back to the lower court, the judge should ¡°continue to ensure that the Government lives up to its obligations to follow the law.¡± Among those obligations, she said, are several due process protections in immigration statute, as well as the United Nations¡¯ Convention Against Torture. Abrego Garcia was arrested by Department of Homeland Security officers on March 12 and was placed on one of three planes bound for El Salvador days later. But even the Trump administration had acknowledged that an immigration judge had, years earlier, barred his deportation to El Salvador over concerns about his safety in his native country. After his family sued, Xinis ordered the government to return Abrego Garcia by 11:59 p.m. on Monday. But Trump officials said it could not negotiate with El Salvador that quickly and it argued that federal courts could neither compel the president¡¯s foreign policy nor review decisions by the attorney general to execute removal orders. But the Richmond-based 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously sided with Abrego Garcia. Two of three judges concluded that federal law only strips courts of jurisdiction to review lawful decisions by the attorney general. Those judges also concluded that Abrego Garcia remained a detainee of the United States ¨C just one who was being temporarily housed in El Salvador. In other words, the court said, the Trump administration had the power to return him on its own. Abrego Garcia entered the country illegally sometime around 2011, but an immigration judge in 2019 ¨C after reviewing evidence ¨C withheld his removal. That meant that Abrego Garcia could not be deported to El Salvador. A gang in his native country, the immigration judge found, had been ¡°targeting him and threatening him with death because of his family¡¯s pupusa business.¡± Solicitor General D. John Sauer, the Trump administration¡¯s newly confirmed top appellate attorney, claimed that Abrego Garcia is a ¡°ranking member¡± of the MS-13 gang. Because the Trump administration designated MS-13 as a foreign terrorist organization, Sauer argued, the withholding from the immigration court was no longer enforceable. The administration alleges that Abrego Garcia was arrested ¡°in the company of other ranking gang members¡± and that he was confirmed to be a member of the gang by a ¡°reliable source.¡± But Abrego Garcia¡¯s lawyers have stressed that their client has no criminal charges in Maryland, or anywhere else. And they have denied his involvement in MS-13. The evidence suggests that Abrego Garcia is ¡°a gainfully employed family man who lives a law abiding and productive life,¡± wrote US Circuit Judge Stephanie Thacker, an Obama nominee. ¡°The government has made no effort to demonstrate that Abrego Garcia is, in fact, a member of any gang,¡± in the current case. Abrego Garcia was sent to the notorious prison in El Salvador on March 15. Several of the immigrants loaded onto those planes were deported under Trump¡¯s invocation of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act ¨C an invocation that has drawn its own flood of legal challenges, including a case that went up to the Supreme Court. But Abrego Garcia was deported under different authorities. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court delivered Trump a partial win, allowing him to continue to use the controversial Alien Enemies Act but also requiring officials to provide notice to people who could be subject to the act so they may attempt to have a judge review their case. It¡¯s not yet clear how that will work in practice. The Supreme Court did not fill in details about how much notice detainees should be given and how lower courts should handle those proceedings. The Supreme Court¡¯s ruling also left uncertain the fate of people who had already been deported under the act. This story has been updated with additional developments. CNN¡¯s Paula Reid, Priscilla Alvarez and Devan Cole contributed to this report.

Abrego Garcia was arrested by Department of Homeland Security officers on March 12 and was placed on one of three planes bound for El Salvador days later. But even the Trump administration had acknowledged that an immigration judge had, years earlier, barred his deportation to El Salvador over concerns about his safety in his native country. After his family sued, Xinis ordered the government to return Abrego Garcia by 11:59 p.m. on Monday. But Trump officials said it could not negotiate with El Salvador that quickly and it argued that federal courts could neither compel the president¡¯s foreign policy nor review decisions by the attorney general to execute removal orders.

Two of three judges concluded that federal law only strips courts of jurisdiction to review lawful decisions by the attorney general.

In other words, the court said, the Trump administration had the power to return him on its own. Abrego Garcia entered the country illegally sometime around 2011, but an immigration judge in 2019 ¨C after reviewing evidence ¨C withheld his removal.

John Sauer, the Trump administration¡¯s newly confirmed top appellate attorney, claimed that Abrego Garcia is a ¡°ranking member¡± of the MS-13 gang.

2025-04-11 21:04:33,334 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: A federal judge on Friday ruled that the United States must bring back a man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador last month. Judge Paula Xinis of the US District Court in Maryland directed the federal government to return Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, to the US no later than 11:59 p.m. on April 7. The Trump administration conceded in a court filing Monday it mistakenly deported the Maryland father of three ¡°because of an administrative error,¡± but said it could not bring him back because he is in Salvadoran custody. It appeared to mark the first time the administration has admitted an error related to its recent deportation flights to El Salvador, which are now at the center of a fraught legal battle. ¡°This case is certainly important to Abrego Garcia and his family,¡± the judge said. ¡°In recognition of that. I feel like I can¡¯t wait on giving my order.¡± Over the course of the hearing, Xinis had repeatedly raised issues with Abrego Garcia¡¯s removal to El Salvador, given that an immigration judge had previously granted him withholding of removal, meaning he could suffer persecution if removed from the US to El Salvador. He was still considered removable; it just couldn¡¯t be to El Salvador. Xinis cited that status in her ruling, saying Abrego Garcia was apprehended last month ¡°without legal basis¡± and deported ¡°without justification of legal basis.¡± ¡°This was an illegal act,¡± Xinis said. ¡°Congress said you can¡¯t do it, and you did it anyway.¡± Related article
Mistaken deportations stoke concerns over Trump¡¯s aggressive immigration push Department of Justice attorney Erez Reuveni conceded to Abrego Garcia¡¯s attorneys¡¯ arguments that he should not have been deported to El Salvador, saying, ¡°Our only arguments are jurisdictional ¡­ he should not have been sent to El Salvador.¡± Xinis, an Obama appointee, questioned why the US could not bring Abrego Garcia back, given the US¡¯ $6 million contract with the El Salvadorian prison facility, the Center for Terrorism Confinement. ¡°Why can¡¯t the United States get Mr. Abrego Garcia back?¡± Xinis asked. ¡°The first thing I did when I got this case on my desk is ask my clients the same question,¡± Reuveni responded, but he said that he did not get a direct answer. ¡°All of this points to a functional control and that if the United States as a contracted party can have functional control of the placement, the wrongful placement, they certainly have the functional control of the return,¡± Xinis said. Reuveni called his own lack of information on why the US couldn¡¯t bring bring him back ¡°frustrating,¡± but added, ¡°The United States can¡¯t call someone in El Salvador, have them pick up the phone and say ¡®give us our guy back.¡¯¡± The DOJ lawyer appeared to suggest that he had asked the government to return Abrego Garcia, but they did not heed his advice. He then asked the judge for 24 hours to go back to the DOJ, but it was unclear exactly what this request was for. Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, the lawyer for Abrego Garcia, asked for the court to order his client¡¯s return to the US, saying he isn¡¯t asking for ¡°micro-managing¡± by the court, but that the government be ¡°put on a leash¡± to ensure this is done in a timely manner. ¡°At least today, it doesn¡¯t seem like they¡¯re taking it seriously,¡± Sandoval-Moshenberg said after Reuveni¡¯s arguments before the bench. During the hearing, Xinis also appeared skeptical about Abrego Garcia¡¯s alleged ties to the MS-13 gang, which Trump officials have maintained, saying that she had not seen sufficient evidence to that effect. ¡°When someone is accused of membership in such a violent and predatory organization, it comes in the form of an indictment, complaint, criminal proceeding that has a robust process,¡± she said. The Justice Department didn¡¯t provide additional evidence beyond what¡¯s already been submitted in the case. ¡°The government made a choice here to produce no evidence,¡± DOJ attorney Erez Reuveni told the judge. The Trump administration later Friday appealed the judge¡¯s ruling, according to a court filing. The case has been appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Since taking office, President Donald Trump and his team have taken extraordinary measures to crack down on immigration, including invoking a rarely used wartime authority, known as the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, that has pitted the administration against another federal judge and prompted public backlash. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has made multiple missteps in recent weeks, including deporting Abrego Garcia. The errors kept happening despite federal agents assuring they are carefully vetting each person before putting them on flights to a notorious prison in El Salvador. Stephen Miller, Trump¡¯s White House deputy chief of staff, on Friday called Xinis a ¡°Marxist judge¡± who ¡°now thinks she¡¯s president of El Salvador.¡± ¡°Marxist judge now thinks she¡¯s president of El Salvador,¡± Miller wrote in a post on X.

Tattoos, flyers and deleted photos: The limited evidence the Trump administration is using to try to deport migrants In a news conference Friday outside the courthouse, Jennifer, the wife of Abrego Garcia, said that she will ¡°continue fighting for Kilmar.¡± Sandoval-Moshenberg expressed concern about whether the government would comply with Xinis¡¯ order. ¡°I really, sincerely hope that [the government] will abide by that order and walk away from this case and leave well enough alone. They do not need to appeal this decision. They do not need to seek a stay. They should simply obey the judge¡¯s order, bring him back to the United States by Monday,¡± Sandoval-Moshenberg said. ¡°An apology would be nice, but I am not expecting that.¡± After the news conference, Sandoval-Moshenberg told CNN, ¡°I¡¯m a lawyer, I have to assume initially that they will comply with the judge¡¯s order unless it is stayed by a higher court. If they don¡¯t, we will be right back here asking the judge to enforce her order.¡± The attorney also cast doubt on the government¡¯s notion that they cannot bring Abrego Garcia home, alluding to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem¡¯s visit to Cecot earlier this week. ¡°I don¡¯t see how they can even plausibly argue that there¡¯s no capacity to bring someone back,¡± Sandoval-Moshenberg said ¡°Maybe they could have made that argument prior to Wednesday of last week, but as soon as they put Kristi Noem within the walls of that prison, they really kneecap their argument to say that they can¡¯t get someone out of that prison ¡ª because they got Kristi Noem out of that prison.¡± This story has been updated with additional reporting.

The Trump administration later Friday appealed the judge¡¯s ruling, according to a court filing. The case has been appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Since taking office, President Donald Trump and his team have taken extraordinary measures to crack down on immigration, including invoking a rarely used wartime authority, known as the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, that has pitted the administration against another federal judge and prompted public backlash. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has made multiple missteps in recent weeks, including deporting Abrego Garcia. The errors kept happening despite federal agents assuring they are carefully vetting each person before putting them on flights to a notorious prison in El Salvador. Stephen Miller, Trump¡¯s White House deputy chief of staff, on Friday called Xinis a ¡°Marxist judge¡± who ¡°now thinks she¡¯s president of El Salvador.¡± ¡°Marxist judge now thinks she¡¯s president of El Salvador,¡± Miller wrote in a post on X.

Tattoos, flyers and deleted photos: The limited evidence the Trump administration is using to try to deport migrants In a news conference Friday outside the courthouse, Jennifer, the wife of Abrego Garcia, said that she will ¡°continue fighting for Kilmar.¡± Sandoval-Moshenberg expressed concern about whether the government would comply with Xinis¡¯ order. ¡°I really, sincerely hope that [the government] will abide by that order and walk away from this case and leave well enough alone. They do not need to appeal this decision. They do not need to seek a stay. They should simply obey the judge¡¯s order, bring him back to the United States by Monday,¡± Sandoval-Moshenberg said. ¡°An apology would be nice, but I am not expecting that.¡± After the news conference, Sandoval-Moshenberg told CNN, ¡°I¡¯m a lawyer, I have to assume initially that they will comply with the judge¡¯s order unless it is stayed by a higher court. If they don¡¯t, we will be right back here asking the judge to enforce her order.¡± The attorney also cast doubt on the government¡¯s notion that they cannot bring Abrego Garcia home, alluding to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem¡¯s visit to Cecot earlier this week. ¡°I don¡¯t see how they can even plausibly argue that there¡¯s no capacity to bring someone back,¡± Sandoval-Moshenberg said ¡°Maybe they could have made that argument prior to Wednesday of last week, but as soon as they put Kristi Noem within the walls of that prison, they really kneecap their argument to say that they can¡¯t get someone out of that prison ¡ª because they got Kristi Noem out of that prison.¡± This story has been updated with additional reporting.

2025-04-11 21:05:40,253 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: A heated email exchange between Richard Grenell, the interim head of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and one of its artists left the musician ¡°shocked¡± by what she called a ¡°bizarre¡± interaction. Grenell seemed ¡°aggressively upset¡± during the exchange on Tuesday, musician Yasmin Williams told CNN in an interview Thursday. She had initially emailed Grenell, who is also currently serving as President Donald Trump¡¯s envoy for special missions, about concerns she¡¯s heard from other musicians and former patrons about the center¡¯s moves to roll back diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; cancel certain shows; and eliminate board members. ¡°I was shocked at first if anything because, honestly, I thought it was fake. I thought it was just like, is this ChatGPT?

It was just bizarre.¡± The musician questioned Grenell about recent changes, writing over email, ¡°Does the President actually care about artists cancelling shows at the Kennedy Center? What, if anything, has changed about the Kennedy Center regarding hiring practices, performance booking, and staffing?¡± Related article
Trump uses Kennedy Center visit to criticize the venue and tout his efforts to remake it Grenell, a longtime Trump confidant already serving in multiple administration positions who Trump named to the director role in February, said in response in the email thread, ¡°Let me ask you this question, would you play for Republicans or would you boycott if Republicans came to your show?¡± Williams told CNN Grenell¡¯s response ¡°made absolutely no sense.¡± CNN has reached out to the Kennedy Center and Grenell for comment. The exchange puts Trump¡¯s aggressive push to reshape the Kennedy Center into sharp focus, as the Washington, DC-based performing arts complex has been thrust into the middle of the culture wars. ¡°Just last year, the Kennedy Center featured Drag Shows specifically targeting our youth ¡ª THIS WILL STOP. The Kennedy Center is an American Jewel, and must reflect the brightest STARS on its stage from all across our Nation,¡± the president posted on social media in February. The president has targeted the center in a slew of changes, including dismissing its board and installing himself as its chairman in February. Artists including Issa Rae, Shonda Rhimes and Ben Folds have resigned from their leadership roles or canceled events at the space in response to the changes, while the center has canceled performances, including the children¡¯s musical ¡°Finn.¡± During the exchange, Williams wrote back in an email that she has played for Republicans before and that ¡°boycotting anything because Republicans exist and may be at a show of mine makes no sense to me.¡±  Grenell responded that the artists who cancelled their shows did so because they couldn¡¯t be in the presence of Republicans and advised the musician to not ¡°be gullible¡± and ¡°swallow what the media tells you.¡± ¡°Your people also booed and harassed the vice president who simply wanted to enjoy music with his wife for a night. Who is the intolerant one?¡± Grenell continued, referring to an incident  last month in which Vice President JD Vance was booed as he entered a concert hall at the Kennedy Center. In another email, Grenell told the musician, ¡°Yes, I cut the DEI bullshit because we can¡¯t afford to pay people for fringe and niche programming that the public won¡¯t support. Yes, I cut the people making over $500k a year because we are in debt.¡± Williams, who is Black, criticized his comments on DEI as ¡°egregiously unprofessional and ridiculous.¡± Related article

The Kennedy Center is among a number of cultural institutions Trump has targeted as part of a broader push to influence American arts and culture since the start of his second term. He directed his administration last month to scrutinize and threaten funding for the Smithsonian Institution to force federal museums to ¡°remove improper ideology¡± from their exhibits. And he specifically targeted the National Museum of African American History and Culture and the Smithsonian American Art Museum for carrying exhibits and promoting language he deemed inappropriate. The president also signed an order last month directing the Institution of Museum and Library Services, among several other government entities, to be ¡°eliminated to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law.¡± CNN¡¯s Kylie Atwood contributed to this report.

2025-04-11 21:26:17,772 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: Embattled South Korean superstar Kim Soo Hyun has personally addressed a growing scandal about the nature of his relationship with late actress Kim Sae-ron for the first time, in a closely watched saga that has roiled the country¡¯s entertainment industry. Speaking at a press conference Monday, a tearful Kim Soo Hyun, 37, said accusations made by a YouTube channel in March that he had entered into a relationship with his fellow  performer when she was still a minor were untrue. He has repeatedly denied the allegations. ¡°I did not date her when she was a minor,¡± Kim said at the emotional news conference, where he declined to take questions. ¡°Apart from the fact that we were both actors, we were just an ordinary couple like anyone else. We had feelings for each other, and as time passed, we eventually parted ways. After that, we rarely kept in touch.¡± After the press conference, a lawyer for the actor and his agency, Goldmedalist, announced a lawsuit against multiple parties, including the YouTube channel and the family of Kim Sae-ron, accusing them of defamation and violation of information protection. CNN has reached out to the family for comment. Kim Sae-ron was found dead at home in February at 24 years old, nearly two years after she retreated from public view following a drunk-driving conviction that prompted heavy public backlash and reputational damage. The allegations made by the YouTube channel, known for covering political news, started an online firestorm against Kim Soo Hyun despite his denials. His talent agency previously said that while the two actors had been in a relationship, it took place when both were adults, according to the Chosun Ilbo, one of South Korea¡¯s newspapers of record. The fallout for the actor has been swift, with luxury fashion house Prada and popular Korean cosmetics brand Dinto both ending their collaborations with Kim Soo Hyun in the weeks after the scandal broke. A star at home and across Asia, Kim Soo Hyun is best known for the award-winning series ¡°It¡¯s Okay to Not be Okay¡± and ¡°My Love from the Star.¡± Related article
Top brands drop South Korean actor Kim Soo Hyun after relationship controversy On Monday, he also apologized for staying quiet when the allegations about the relationship emerged last year, saying he was worried about the consequences for his recently aired Netflix series ¡°Queen of Tears.¡± ¡°If you want to criticize me for being cowardly or selfish, I will accept that,¡± he said. Kim Sae-ron was a prolific actor who shot to stardom as a child, but her career stalled after she crashed her car in the South Korean capital in 2022. In April 2023, a Seoul court found her guilty of driving under the influence. She avoided jail but was fined about $14,000. Kim Soo Hyun also claimed that many text messages that had been distributed online, purportedly between him and Kim Sae-ron, were false. There were no signs of foul play and officers are investigating the circumstances of her death, a police official told CNN last month. Correction: A previous version of this story misidentified the time period Kim Soo Hyun had stayed quiet.

2025-04-11 21:29:32,642 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: A family¡¯s afternoon sightseeing excursion above the misty shoreline of Manhattan ended in tragedy Thursday after the helicopter carrying them crashed off the New Jersey shoreline, killing them and the pilot. Spectators watched the helicopter as it dropped from the sky and slammed into the river upside down as fluttering debris landed in the water. The victims included Agust¨ªn Escobar, a Siemens executive, and his family, according to a law enforcement official. The family was visiting from Spain, New York Mayor Eric Adams said during a news conference Thursday. CNN has reached out to the New York Police Department and the US Coast Guard for more information on the victims. While not much is known about why the helicopter crashed, its staggering descent from the sky shocked witnesses as first responders did what they could to rescue the victims. At 3:17 p.m., multiple 911 calls reported a helicopter crash in the Hudson River near the New Jersey coastline at Pier A Park in Hoboken, New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. When first responders arrived, police pulled four people out of the water and FDNY pulled out two people, she said. Four victims were declared dead on scene and an additional two people were taken to local hospitals, Tisch said. Two children were taken to the Jersey City Medical Center before being pronounced dead, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said on X. ¡°Our hearts go out to the family of those who were on board,¡± Adams said. President Donald Trump also sent his condolences via a Truth Social post, saying ¡°God bless the families and friends of the victims¡± and that Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy was looking into the incident. The helicopter, operated by the tour company New York Helicopter Charter, is currently submerged in the river. ¡°The only thing I can tell you is that we are devastated,¡± Michael Roth, the CEO of New York Helicopter Charter Inc., told CNN Thursday evening. ¡°I¡¯m a father, a grandfather and my wife hasn¡¯t stopped crying since this afternoon,¡± he added. When asked about the maintenance of the helicopter, Roth said, ¡°It¡¯s my director of maintenance who deals with that.¡± The company¡¯s director of maintenance declined to comment. Maintenance records are not public and the NTSB limits what companies can say publicly during an investigation. Spain¡¯s Prime Minister, Pedro S¨¢nchez, called the incident ¡°an unimaginable tragedy¡± in a post on X. ¡°I share in the grief of the victims¡¯ loved ones at this heartbreaking time,¡± he said. FlightRadar24 reported the aircraft to be a Bell 206L-4 LongRanger IV, based on ADS-B tracking data. It was built in 2004 and had an airworthiness certificate issued in 2016 that was good until 2029, according to Federal Aviation Administration records. There was no information immediately available on the pilot, according to Adams. The helicopter took off from the downtown Manhattan heliport at 2:59 p.m., where it flew south before turning to fly north along the Manhattan shoreline, up the Hudson River, Tisch said. At 3:08 p.m., the helicopter reached the George Washington Bridge and then turned to fly south along the New Jersey shoreline, where shortly after it lost control, she said. When the helicopter hit the water, officials believe it was inverted, leaving the cabin visible in the water, Tisch said. Reports that the helicopter stopped in mid-air and pieces of the helicopter were falling off before it hit the water is consistent with 911 reports, she said. The cause of the crash is under investigation, she said. The helicopter flew for about 16 minutes before going down into the water, according to analysis by CNN and flight tracking site FlightRadar 24. The flight path reflects much of what officials said, showing the aircraft took off from lower Manhattan and did a circle near the Statue of Liberty before flying up the Hudson River to the George Washington Bridge at about 1000 feet. At that point it turned back south, ultimately coming to rest in the water near New Jersey. The path up the Hudson is a popular sightseeing route. When the helicopter crashed, it was cloudy with winds around 10 to 15 mph with gusts up to 25 mph according to various weather reports in the area. Visibility at the surface was good ¡ª 10 miles ¡ª but it was cloudy as a system is moving into the region, bringing light rain to the region this afternoon and evening. Helicopters on an air traffic control frequency were asked to look for anyone in the water following the crash. ¡°Please keep your eyes open. You guys see anything in the water, please let us know,¡± said an emergency response pilot on the frequency. The FAA is temporarily prohibiting drone pilots from flying near today¡¯s helicopter crash unless they have specific authorization. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed it is investigating the situation alongside the National Transportation Safety Board. The NTSB is leading the investigation and will provide updates. The helicopter was in the Special Flight Rules Area in New York, where no air traffic control services are provided, Secretary Duffy said in a post on X Thursday. Several minutes before entering that area, air traffic control from LaGuardia Airport was providing support, he said. The National Transportation Safety Board chair and investigators are on their way to the site of today¡¯s deadly helicopter crash in the Hudson River. ¡°The NTSB is launching a go-team to investigate Thursday¡¯s crash of a Bell 206 L-4 helicopter near Jersey City, New Jersey,¡± the Board said in a social media post. ¡°The team is expected to arrive tonight.¡± The cause of the crash is under investigation by the NTSB, which will pore over documentation on all the work that had been done on the aircraft. That would include the company¡¯s compliance with two recent Federal Aviation Administration issued airworthiness directives. One directive from May 2023 required the testing and possible replacement of tail rotor drive shafts on eight different Bell 206L models, including the 206L-4. That directive was prompted by an incident in which a Bell 206L helicopter experienced the loss of a tail-rotor drive due to a joint failure. The FAA also issued a December 2022 airworthiness directive on Bell 206L models with specific parts, requiring inspection and possible replacement of the helicopters¡¯ main rotor blades because of ¡°delamination.¡± That refers to layers within the blade separating due to material fatigue, damage (from bird strikes, for example), or manufacturing errors, potentially leading the rotor blade to fail. The helicopter that crashed in the Hudson River was built in 2004 and had an airworthiness certificate issued in 2016 that was valid until 2029, according to FAA records. The company operating the helicopter was previously involved in two safety incidents investigated by federal aviation authorities. In 2015, a pilot for the New York Helicopter Charter company was forced to land in New Jersey after hovering 20 feet in the air for a short time. An initial inspection showed there ¡°may have been corrosion removed¡± from sections of the helicopter and that some of the helicopter¡¯s component parts may have been deformed to an extent to be ¡°considered unairworthy,¡± according to an FAA inspector at the time. The same helicopter was previously involved in a crash in Chile in 2010. In 2013, a pilot for the company was forced to land a helicopter carrying four passengers on the water near Manhattan after hearing a ¡°bang¡± that was followed by the ¡°Engine Out warning horn.¡± The pilot inflated the helicopter¡¯s floats and got the passengers to safety on an approaching boat. This story has been updated with additional information. CNN¡¯s Mark Morales, Alexandra Skores, Matt Stiles and Audrey Ash contributed to this report.

In 2013, a pilot for the company was forced to land a helicopter carrying four passengers on the water near Manhattan after hearing a ¡°bang¡± that was followed by the ¡°Engine Out warning horn.¡± The pilot inflated the helicopter¡¯s floats and got the passengers to safety on an approaching boat. This story has been updated with additional information. CNN¡¯s Mark Morales, Alexandra Skores, Matt Stiles and Audrey Ash contributed to this report.

2025-04-11 21:51:52,669 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: The Supreme Court on Thursday required President Donald Trump¡¯s administration to ¡°facilitate¡± the return of a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador but stopped short of requiring the government to return him to the United States. The high court said that the administration must try to return Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national who was deported on March 15. It said part of the lower court¡¯s order requiring the government to ¡°effectuate¡± his return was unclear and needed further review. The court did not give the administration a deadline for when Abrego Garcia should be returned. The opinion was unsigned and no dissents were noted. ¡°Tonight, the rule of law prevailed. The Supreme Court upheld the District Judge¡¯s order that the government has to bring Kilmar home,¡± said Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Abrego Garcia¡¯s attorneys. ¡°Now they need to stop wasting time and get moving.¡± But the Trump administration also framed the decision as a win for its position. ¡°As the Supreme Court correctly recognized, it is the exclusive prerogative of the president to conduct foreign affairs,¡± a Department of Justice spokesperson said. ¡°By directly noting the deference owed to the executive branch, this ruling once again illustrates that activist judges do not have the jurisdiction to seize control of the president¡¯s authority to conduct foreign policy.¡± The high court¡¯s unsigned and brief decision left US District Judge Paula Xinis¡¯ order in place but drew a distinction between ¡°facilitating¡± Abrego Garcia¡¯s return and ¡°effectuating¡± it. The lower court properly required the government to ¡°facilitate¡± his return, the justices made clear. ¡°The intended scope of the term ¡®effectuate¡¯ in the District Court¡¯s order is, however, unclear, and may exceed the District Court¡¯s authority,¡± the court wrote Thursday. Therefore, the court said, Xinis should ¡°clarify its directive, with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs.¡± That appeared to be a nod to the Trump administration¡¯s arguments in the case. In written briefs, the Trump administration had warned that requiring it to ¡°effectuate¡± the return of Abrego Garcia would violate separation of powers principles. And it defined ¡°facilitate¡± narrowly in those briefs ¨C essentially, removing any barriers to his return. Ultimately, the majority left it to the lower court to sort out how to strike the balance.

Supreme Court says Trump doesn¡¯t have to rehire independent labor board members for now ¡°Although the ruling makes clear that the district court can order the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia¡¯s return to the United States, it is maddeningly vague about exactly how it¡¯s supposed to do so,¡± said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center. ¡°For instance, if the judge asks the government about the specific arrangements it¡¯s made with the Salvadoran government and the government invokes the state secrets privilege, what happens then?¡± Vladeck added. ¡°It is, yet again, punting in a context in which the government can take advantage of the punt ¨C a loss for Trump on the big question, but a loss for Abrego Garc¨ªa on what matters most.¡± ¡°The Supreme Court¡¯s opinion today gives the administration cover to ¡®try¡¯ to bring him home but does not require the federal government ¨C the executive branch ¨C to bring Mr. Abrego Garcia home,¡± Elora Mukherjee, director of the Immigrants¡¯ Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School, told CNN. ¡°It¡¯s a decision that doesn¡¯t protect Mr. Abrego Garcia to the fullest extent that the law should.¡± Xinis on Thursday night ordered the Trump administration to ¡°take all available steps to facilitate¡± the return of Abrego Garcia, hours after the Supreme Court¡¯s order. The lower court judge also ordered lawyers for the Justice Department to provide her with a sworn statement by 9:30 a.m. ET Friday from an individual ¡°with personal knowledge¡± of the steps the government has or is planning to take to secure Abrego Garcia¡¯s return. Xinis scheduled a hearing over the issue for Friday afternoon. The court¡¯s three liberals didn¡¯t dissent from the decision but wrote separately to argue that the Trump administration¡¯s emergency appeal should have been denied in full. Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed the administration to existing executive branch policy that the federal government should ¡°facilitate [an] alien¡¯s return to the United States if ¡­ the alien¡¯s presence is necessary for continued administrative removal proceedings.¡± Sotomayor¡¯s statement criticized the Trump administration for dismissing the mistaken removal as an ¡°oversight,¡± rather than ¡°hastening to correct its egregious error.¡± ¡°The Government now requests an order from this Court permitting it to leave Abrego Garcia, a husband and father without a criminal record, in a Salvadoran prison for no reason recognized by the law,¡± she and the other liberals said. ¡°The only argument the Government offers in support of its request, that United States courts cannot grant relief once a deportee crosses the border, is plainly wrong.¡± Sotomayor said that when the proceedings go back to the lower court, the judge should ¡°continue to ensure that the Government lives up to its obligations to follow the law.¡± Among those obligations, she said, are several due process protections in immigration statute, as well as the United Nations¡¯ Convention Against Torture. Abrego Garcia was arrested by Department of Homeland Security officers on March 12 and was placed on one of three planes bound for El Salvador days later. But even the Trump administration had acknowledged that an immigration judge had, years earlier, barred his deportation to El Salvador over concerns about his safety in his native country. After his family sued, Xinis ordered the government to return Abrego Garcia by 11:59 p.m. on Monday. But Trump officials said it could not negotiate with El Salvador that quickly and it argued that federal courts could neither compel the president¡¯s foreign policy nor review decisions by the attorney general to execute removal orders. But the Richmond-based 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously sided with Abrego Garcia. Two of three judges concluded that federal law only strips courts of jurisdiction to review lawful decisions by the attorney general. Those judges also concluded that Abrego Garcia remained a detainee of the United States ¨C just one who was being temporarily housed in El Salvador. In other words, the court said, the Trump administration had the power to return him on its own. Abrego Garcia entered the country illegally sometime around 2011, but an immigration judge in 2019 ¨C after reviewing evidence ¨C withheld his removal. That meant that Abrego Garcia could not be deported to El Salvador. A gang in his native country, the immigration judge found, had been ¡°targeting him and threatening him with death because of his family¡¯s pupusa business.¡± Solicitor General D. John Sauer, the Trump administration¡¯s newly confirmed top appellate attorney, claimed that Abrego Garcia is a ¡°ranking member¡± of the MS-13 gang. Because the Trump administration designated MS-13 as a foreign terrorist organization, Sauer argued, the withholding from the immigration court was no longer enforceable. The administration alleges that Abrego Garcia was arrested ¡°in the company of other ranking gang members¡± and that he was confirmed to be a member of the gang by a ¡°reliable source.¡± But Abrego Garcia¡¯s lawyers have stressed that their client has no criminal charges in Maryland, or anywhere else. And they have denied his involvement in MS-13. The evidence suggests that Abrego Garcia is ¡°a gainfully employed family man who lives a law abiding and productive life,¡± wrote US Circuit Judge Stephanie Thacker, an Obama nominee. ¡°The government has made no effort to demonstrate that Abrego Garcia is, in fact, a member of any gang,¡± in the current case. Abrego Garcia was sent to the notorious prison in El Salvador on March 15. Several of the immigrants loaded onto those planes were deported under Trump¡¯s invocation of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act ¨C an invocation that has drawn its own flood of legal challenges, including a case that went up to the Supreme Court. But Abrego Garcia was deported under different authorities. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court delivered Trump a partial win, allowing him to continue to use the controversial Alien Enemies Act but also requiring officials to provide notice to people who could be subject to the act so they may attempt to have a judge review their case. It¡¯s not yet clear how that will work in practice. The Supreme Court did not fill in details about how much notice detainees should be given and how lower courts should handle those proceedings. The Supreme Court¡¯s ruling also left uncertain the fate of people who had already been deported under the act. This story has been updated with additional developments.

2025-04-11 21:51:54,683 - Try_train - INFO - Found 10 articles for: The Supreme Court on Thursday required President Donald Trump¡¯s administration to ¡°facilitate¡± the return of a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador but stopped short of requiring the government to return him to the United States. The high court said that the administration must try to return Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national who was deported on March 15. It said part of the lower court¡¯s order requiring the government to ¡°effectuate¡± his return was unclear and needed further review. The court did not give the administration a deadline for when Abrego Garcia should be returned. The opinion was unsigned and no dissents were noted. ¡°Tonight, the rule of law prevailed. The Supreme Court upheld the District Judge¡¯s order that the government has to bring Kilmar home,¡± said Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Abrego Garcia¡¯s attorneys. ¡°Now they need to stop wasting time and get moving.¡± But the Trump administration also framed the decision as a win for its position. ¡°As the Supreme Court correctly recognized, it is the exclusive prerogative of the president to conduct foreign affairs,¡± a Department of Justice spokesperson said. ¡°By directly noting the deference owed to the executive branch, this ruling once again illustrates that activist judges do not have the jurisdiction to seize control of the president¡¯s authority to conduct foreign policy.¡± The high court¡¯s unsigned and brief decision left US District Judge Paula Xinis¡¯ order in place but drew a distinction between ¡°facilitating¡± Abrego Garcia¡¯s return and ¡°effectuating¡± it. The lower court properly required the government to ¡°facilitate¡± his return, the justices made clear. ¡°The intended scope of the term ¡®effectuate¡¯ in the District Court¡¯s order is, however, unclear, and may exceed the District Court¡¯s authority,¡± the court wrote Thursday. Therefore, the court said, Xinis should ¡°clarify its directive, with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs.¡± That appeared to be a nod to the Trump administration¡¯s arguments in the case. In written briefs, the Trump administration had warned that requiring it to ¡°effectuate¡± the return of Abrego Garcia would violate separation of powers principles. And it defined ¡°facilitate¡± narrowly in those briefs ¨C essentially, removing any barriers to his return. Ultimately, the majority left it to the lower court to sort out how to strike the balance.

Supreme Court says Trump doesn¡¯t have to rehire independent labor board members for now ¡°Although the ruling makes clear that the district court can order the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia¡¯s return to the United States, it is maddeningly vague about exactly how it¡¯s supposed to do so,¡± said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at Georgetown University Law Center. ¡°For instance, if the judge asks the government about the specific arrangements it¡¯s made with the Salvadoran government and the government invokes the state secrets privilege, what happens then?¡± Vladeck added. ¡°It is, yet again, punting in a context in which the government can take advantage of the punt ¨C a loss for Trump on the big question, but a loss for Abrego Garc¨ªa on what matters most.¡± ¡°The Supreme Court¡¯s opinion today gives the administration cover to ¡®try¡¯ to bring him home but does not require the federal government ¨C the executive branch ¨C to bring Mr. Abrego Garcia home,¡± Elora Mukherjee, director of the Immigrants¡¯ Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School, told CNN. ¡°It¡¯s a decision that doesn¡¯t protect Mr. Abrego Garcia to the fullest extent that the law should.¡± Xinis on Thursday night ordered the Trump administration to ¡°take all available steps to facilitate¡± the return of Abrego Garcia, hours after the Supreme Court¡¯s order. The lower court judge also ordered lawyers for the Justice Department to provide her with a sworn statement by 9:30 a.m. ET Friday from an individual ¡°with personal knowledge¡± of the steps the government has or is planning to take to secure Abrego Garcia¡¯s return. Xinis scheduled a hearing over the issue for Friday afternoon. The court¡¯s three liberals didn¡¯t dissent from the decision but wrote separately to argue that the Trump administration¡¯s emergency appeal should have been denied in full. Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed the administration to existing executive branch policy that the federal government should ¡°facilitate [an] alien¡¯s return to the United States if ¡­ the alien¡¯s presence is necessary for continued administrative removal proceedings.¡± Sotomayor¡¯s statement criticized the Trump administration for dismissing the mistaken removal as an ¡°oversight,¡± rather than ¡°hastening to correct its egregious error.¡± ¡°The Government now requests an order from this Court permitting it to leave Abrego Garcia, a husband and father without a criminal record, in a Salvadoran prison for no reason recognized by the law,¡± she and the other liberals said. ¡°The only argument the Government offers in support of its request, that United States courts cannot grant relief once a deportee crosses the border, is plainly wrong.¡± Sotomayor said that when the proceedings go back to the lower court, the judge should ¡°continue to ensure that the Government lives up to its obligations to follow the law.¡± Among those obligations, she said, are several due process protections in immigration statute, as well as the United Nations¡¯ Convention Against Torture. Abrego Garcia was arrested by Department of Homeland Security officers on March 12 and was placed on one of three planes bound for El Salvador days later. But even the Trump administration had acknowledged that an immigration judge had, years earlier, barred his deportation to El Salvador over concerns about his safety in his native country. After his family sued, Xinis ordered the government to return Abrego Garcia by 11:59 p.m. on Monday. But Trump officials said it could not negotiate with El Salvador that quickly and it argued that federal courts could neither compel the president¡¯s foreign policy nor review decisions by the attorney general to execute removal orders. But the Richmond-based 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously sided with Abrego Garcia. Two of three judges concluded that federal law only strips courts of jurisdiction to review lawful decisions by the attorney general. Those judges also concluded that Abrego Garcia remained a detainee of the United States ¨C just one who was being temporarily housed in El Salvador. In other words, the court said, the Trump administration had the power to return him on its own. Abrego Garcia entered the country illegally sometime around 2011, but an immigration judge in 2019 ¨C after reviewing evidence ¨C withheld his removal. That meant that Abrego Garcia could not be deported to El Salvador. A gang in his native country, the immigration judge found, had been ¡°targeting him and threatening him with death because of his family¡¯s pupusa business.¡± Solicitor General D. John Sauer, the Trump administration¡¯s newly confirmed top appellate attorney, claimed that Abrego Garcia is a ¡°ranking member¡± of the MS-13 gang. Because the Trump administration designated MS-13 as a foreign terrorist organization, Sauer argued, the withholding from the immigration court was no longer enforceable. The administration alleges that Abrego Garcia was arrested ¡°in the company of other ranking gang members¡± and that he was confirmed to be a member of the gang by a ¡°reliable source.¡± But Abrego Garcia¡¯s lawyers have stressed that their client has no criminal charges in Maryland, or anywhere else. And they have denied his involvement in MS-13. The evidence suggests that Abrego Garcia is ¡°a gainfully employed family man who lives a law abiding and productive life,¡± wrote US Circuit Judge Stephanie Thacker, an Obama nominee. ¡°The government has made no effort to demonstrate that Abrego Garcia is, in fact, a member of any gang,¡± in the current case. Abrego Garcia was sent to the notorious prison in El Salvador on March 15. Several of the immigrants loaded onto those planes were deported under Trump¡¯s invocation of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act ¨C an invocation that has drawn its own flood of legal challenges, including a case that went up to the Supreme Court. But Abrego Garcia was deported under different authorities.

2025-04-12 01:16:01,504 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: A sightseeing helicopter plunged into the Hudson River on Thursday, turning a family outing above Manhattan¡¯s misty skyline into a tragedy. The helicopter carried six people, including three children and their parents ¨C who have both worked for Siemens, a German multinational technology conglomerate. It lifted off from a Manhattan heliport and followed a familiar route: circling the Statue of Liberty, gliding north along the Hudson toward the George Washington Bridge and then turning south. About 16 minutes after takeoff, the aircraft crashed into the water, according to analysis by CNN and FlightRadar24. Witnesses described the helicopter flipping and spiraling before crashing near the New Jersey shoreline upside down, scattering debris across the river. ¡°The helicopter was a little bit like nose down, slightly, and I saw the propeller separating from the helicopter. It kept spinning in the air alone. Nothing was attached to it,¡± Sarah Jane Raymond Ryer, who saw the crash unfold, told CNN affiliate WCBS. A video obtained by CNN shows the rotor blades detached from the helicopter and flying through the air. ¡°The videotape in this case is very dramatic and very important to the investigation,¡± former National Transportation Safety Board managing director Peter Goelz told CNN on Friday. Eyewitness Avi Rakesh told CNN¡¯s Jessica Dean that what was left of the helicopter appeared to be so out of control, he didn¡¯t feel safe in his own building. ¡°Debris was flying everywhere. I was concerned that something might come and hit the window,¡± Rakesh said. Here¡¯s what we know about the crash that killed everyone on board: The victims include Agust¨ªn Escobar, 49, his wife, Merc¨¨ Camprub¨ª Montal, and their three children. New York City Mayor Eric Adams said the family was visiting from Spain, and Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said in a social media post that the family was in New York to celebrate Camprub¨ª¡¯s 40th birthday. ¡°We are deeply saddened by the tragic helicopter crash in which Agustin Escobar and his family lost their lives. Our heartfelt condolences go out to all their loved ones,¡± a Siemens Mobility spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. Escobar served as CEO of Rail Infrastructure at Siemens Mobility, the transportation solutions division of Siemens AG. Spain¡¯s Prime Minister, Pedro S¨¢nchez, expressed his condolences, calling the incident ¡°an unimaginable tragedy.¡± Camprub¨ª was the global commercialization manager for Siemens Energy, according to her LinkedIn page. Siemens Energy is an independent company that was spun off from Siemens AG in 2020. ¡°We are deeply saddened and shocked by the loss of a colleague due to a tragic accident during vacation,¡± said a statement from Siemens Energy. ¡°Our thoughts and heartfelt condolences go out to the family, friends and colleagues of the victims.¡± In addition to her international corporate career, Camprub¨ª is known in Spain as a member of a prominent sports family. Camprub¨ª¡¯s grandfather and great-grandfather both served as presidents of FC Barcelona, one of the most popular soccer clubs in the world. The pilot was also killed, though officials have not yet released their identity. CNN has reached out to the New York Police Department and the US Coast Guard for more information on the victims. The cause of the crash remains unclear, but its sudden descent stunned witnesses as first responders raced to rescue the victims. The helicopter took off at 2:59 p.m. from Manhattan¡¯s downtown heliport following a popular sightseeing route, New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. After circling the Statue of Liberty, it flew north along the Hudson River, reaching the George Washington Bridge by 3:08 p.m. It then turned south along the New Jersey shoreline, where it lost control shortly after, Tisch said.

A Siemens exec, his family and their pilot are dead after helicopter crashes into the Hudson River Visibility at the time was 10 miles, though the region was cloudy with winds of 10 to 15 mph and gusts up to 25 mph. A weather system was expected to bring light rain later in the afternoon. At 3:17 p.m., multiple 911 calls reported a crash near Pier A Park in Hoboken, New Jersey. Witnesses said the helicopter appeared to stop midair before pieces broke off, consistent with preliminary emergency reports, Tisch said. Jersey City resident, Ipsitaa Banigrhi, described the sound as ¡°such a loud sound. It felt like thunder,¡± she told WCBS. ¡°Then I saw black particles flying. Again, I thought maybe it¡¯s just dust or birds, and then we heard all the emergency vehicles and sirens go by. I think that¡¯s when it was like, ¡®OK, what¡¯s happening.¡¯¡± With the helicopter¡¯s catastrophic failure in midair, there was no way to guide the aircraft to safety, a former combat pilot told CNN¡¯s Kate Bolduan. ¡°There¡¯s nothing that pilot could have done in that situation to recover the aircraft,¡± Brandt Anderson said. First responders from NYPD and New York City Fire Department teams pulled six people from the water. Four victims were pronounced dead at the scene, and two others succumbed to injuries shortly after, Tisch said. Two children were taken to Jersey City Medical Center, where they were later pronounced dead, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said on X. The aircraft¡¯s main fuselage was retrieved from the river on Thursday evening, and dive operations continued Friday, WCBS reported. The company operating the helicopter was previously involved in two safety incidents investigated by federal aviation authorities. In 2015, a pilot for the New York Helicopter Charter company was forced to land in New Jersey after hovering 20 feet in the air for a short time. An initial inspection showed there ¡°may have been corrosion removed¡± from sections of the helicopter and that some of the helicopter¡¯s component parts may have been deformed to an extent to be ¡°considered unairworthy,¡± according to an FAA inspector at the time. The same helicopter was previously involved in a crash in Chile in 2010. In 2013, a pilot for the company was forced to land a helicopter carrying four passengers on the water near Manhattan after hearing a ¡°bang¡± that was followed by the ¡°Engine Out warning horn.¡± The pilot inflated the helicopter¡¯s floats and got the passengers to safety on a boat. ¡°The only thing I can tell you is that we are devastated,¡± Michael Roth, the CEO of the company operating the flight, told CNN of Thursday¡¯s crash. ¡°I¡¯m a father, a grandfather and my wife hasn¡¯t stopped crying since this afternoon.¡± When asked about the helicopter¡¯s maintenance, he said, ¡°That¡¯s something my director of maintenance handles.¡± The director of maintenance declined to comment. Maintenance records are not publicly accessible, and the NTSB restricts what companies can disclose during an ongoing investigation. ¡°(The pilot) called in that he was landing and that he needed fuel, and it should have taken him about three minutes to arrive, but 20 minutes later, he didn¡¯t arrive,¡± Roth told The Telegraph Thursday. The helicopter, a Bell 206L-4 LongRanger IV, was built in 2004 and held an airworthiness certificate issued in 2016 that was valid through 2029, according to Federal Aviation Administration records. Maintenance records are not public and during investigations NTSB rules prohibit companies from releasing certain information relating to the accident. The investigation into the cause of the crash will pore over documentation on all the work that was done on the aircraft. That would include the company¡¯s compliance with two recent FAA-issued airworthiness directives. One directive from May 2023, required the testing and possible replacement of tail rotor drive shafts on eight different Bell 206L models, including the 206L-4. That directive was prompted by an incident in which a Bell 206L helicopter experienced the loss of a tail-rotor drive due to a joint failure. The FAA also issued a December 2022 airworthiness directive on Bell 206L models with specific parts requiring inspection and possible replacement of the helicopters¡¯ main rotor blades because of ¡°delamination.¡± That refers to layers within the blade separating due to material fatigue, damage (from bird strikes, for example), or manufacturing errors, potentially leading the rotor blade to fail. It remains unclear whether any of these issues played a role in Thursday¡¯s crash. Both the FAA and the NTSB are investigating the crash. The NTSB has dispatched a ¡°go-team¡± to the site to examine the wreckage and review maintenance records, it said on social media, and is asking the public to submit any additional video or photos they may have. The helicopter was flying within New York¡¯s Special Flight Rules Area in New York, where air traffic control support is limited, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said in a post on X. Duffy added that the helicopter had received air traffic assistance from LaGuardia Airport shortly before entering the uncontrolled zone. This story has been updated with additional information.

Duffy added that the helicopter had received air traffic assistance from LaGuardia Airport shortly before entering the uncontrolled zone. This story has been updated with additional information.

2025-04-12 01:17:29,622 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: The US announced it removed the commander of the Pituffik Space Base in Greenland on Thursday because of a ¡°loss of confidence in her ability to lead,¡± after Vice President JD Vance¡¯s controversial visit to the semiautonomous island last month. ¡°Actions to undermine the chain of command or to subvert President Trump¡¯s agenda will not be tolerated at the Department of Defense,¡± Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell wrote in a statement posted to X on Thursday announcing the removal of Susannah Meyers. Following Vance¡¯s visit to the island in late March, Military.com reported that Meyers sent out an email to the space base pushing back on the vice president¡¯s actions and comments during the trip. Parnell included a link to the Military.com story in his X post. The news site reported the ousted commander wrote in an email, ¡°I do not presume to understand current politics, but what I do know is the concerns of the U.S. administration discussed by Vice President Vance on Friday are not reflective of Pituffik Space Base.¡± Colonel Shawn Lee took over Meyers¡¯ position, according to a press release from the Space Operations Command. The removal highlights continued moves for United States control over Greenland as President Donald Trump has vowed to acquire the land ¡°one way or another,¡± and Vance has repeatedly claimed the island is vulnerable and that the US had ¡°no other option¡± than to ramp up its presence there. Vance, alongside his wife, second lady Usha Vance, visited the US Space Force outpost at Pituffik, on the northwest coast of Greenland, 1,000 miles from the capital of Nuuk last month. Usha Vance was originally planning to attend a dogsled race on the island, but expected protests and silent demonstrations altered her visit. During his trip, the vice president made a high-profile case for American control of Greenland, which is a semiautonomous territory of Denmark. He said Greenland would be better off ¡°coming under the United States¡¯ security umbrella than you have been under Denmark¡¯s security umbrella.¡± Trump has also been vocal about his goal to acquire Greenland and has said he ¡°won¡¯t take anything off the table¡± to obtain the island, including military force, but that there is a ¡°good possibility¡± it won¡¯t be needed. He also has confirmed he has ¡°absolutely¡± engaged in serious discussions about the potential annexation of Greenland.

2025-04-12 01:26:37,884 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: A sightseeing helicopter plunged into the Hudson River on Thursday, turning a family outing above Manhattan¡¯s misty skyline into a tragedy. The helicopter carried six people, including three children and their parents ¨C who have both worked for Siemens, a German multinational technology conglomerate. It lifted off from a Manhattan heliport and followed a familiar route: circling the Statue of Liberty, gliding north along the Hudson toward the George Washington Bridge and then turning south. About 16 minutes after takeoff, the aircraft crashed into the water, according to analysis by CNN and FlightRadar24. Witnesses described the helicopter flipping and spiraling before crashing near the New Jersey shoreline upside down, scattering debris across the river. ¡°The helicopter was a little bit like nose down, slightly, and I saw the propeller separating from the helicopter. It kept spinning in the air alone. Nothing was attached to it,¡± Sarah Jane Raymond Ryer, who saw the crash unfold, told CNN affiliate WCBS. A video obtained by CNN shows the rotor blades detached from the helicopter and flying through the air. ¡°The videotape in this case is very dramatic and very important to the investigation,¡± former National Transportation Safety Board managing director Peter Goelz told CNN on Friday. Eyewitness Avi Rakesh told CNN¡¯s Jessica Dean that what was left of the helicopter appeared to be so out of control, he didn¡¯t feel safe in his own building. ¡°Debris was flying everywhere. I was concerned that something might come and hit the window,¡± Rakesh said. Here¡¯s what we know about the crash that killed everyone on board: The victims include Agust¨ªn Escobar, 49, his wife, Merc¨¨ Camprub¨ª Montal, and their three children. New York City Mayor Eric Adams said the family was visiting from Spain, and Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said in a social media post that the family was in New York to celebrate Camprub¨ª¡¯s 40th birthday. ¡°We are deeply saddened by the tragic helicopter crash in which Agustin Escobar and his family lost their lives. Our heartfelt condolences go out to all their loved ones,¡± a Siemens Mobility spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. Escobar served as CEO of Rail Infrastructure at Siemens Mobility, the transportation solutions division of Siemens AG. Spain¡¯s Prime Minister, Pedro S¨¢nchez, expressed his condolences, calling the incident ¡°an unimaginable tragedy.¡± Camprub¨ª was the global commercialization manager for Siemens Energy, according to her LinkedIn page. Siemens Energy is an independent company that was spun off from Siemens AG in 2020. ¡°We are deeply saddened and shocked by the loss of a colleague due to a tragic accident during vacation,¡± said a statement from Siemens Energy. ¡°Our thoughts and heartfelt condolences go out to the family, friends and colleagues of the victims.¡± In addition to her international corporate career, Camprub¨ª is known in Spain as a member of a prominent sports family. Camprub¨ª¡¯s grandfather and great-grandfather both served as presidents of FC Barcelona, one of the most popular soccer clubs in the world. The pilot was also killed, though officials have not yet released their identity. CNN has reached out to the New York Police Department and the US Coast Guard for more information on the victims. The cause of the crash remains unclear, but its sudden descent stunned witnesses as first responders raced to rescue the victims. The helicopter took off at 2:59 p.m. from Manhattan¡¯s downtown heliport following a popular sightseeing route, New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. After circling the Statue of Liberty, it flew north along the Hudson River, reaching the George Washington Bridge by 3:08 p.m. It then turned south along the New Jersey shoreline, where it lost control shortly after, Tisch said.

A Siemens exec, his family and their pilot are dead after helicopter crashes into the Hudson River Visibility at the time was 10 miles, though the region was cloudy with winds of 10 to 15 mph and gusts up to 25 mph. A weather system was expected to bring light rain later in the afternoon. At 3:17 p.m., multiple 911 calls reported a crash near Pier A Park in Hoboken, New Jersey. Witnesses said the helicopter appeared to stop midair before pieces broke off, consistent with preliminary emergency reports, Tisch said. Jersey City resident, Ipsitaa Banigrhi, described the sound as ¡°such a loud sound. It felt like thunder,¡± she told WCBS. ¡°Then I saw black particles flying. Again, I thought maybe it¡¯s just dust or birds, and then we heard all the emergency vehicles and sirens go by. I think that¡¯s when it was like, ¡®OK, what¡¯s happening.¡¯¡± With the helicopter¡¯s catastrophic failure in midair, there was no way to guide the aircraft to safety, a former combat pilot told CNN¡¯s Kate Bolduan. ¡°There¡¯s nothing that pilot could have done in that situation to recover the aircraft,¡± Brandt Anderson said. First responders from NYPD and New York City Fire Department teams pulled six people from the water. Four victims were pronounced dead at the scene, and two others succumbed to injuries shortly after, Tisch said. Two children were taken to Jersey City Medical Center, where they were later pronounced dead, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said on X. The aircraft¡¯s main fuselage was retrieved from the river on Thursday evening, and dive operations continued Friday, WCBS reported. The company operating the helicopter was previously involved in two safety incidents investigated by federal aviation authorities. In 2015, a pilot for the New York Helicopter Charter company was forced to land in New Jersey after hovering 20 feet in the air for a short time. An initial inspection showed there ¡°may have been corrosion removed¡± from sections of the helicopter and that some of the helicopter¡¯s component parts may have been deformed to an extent to be ¡°considered unairworthy,¡± according to an FAA inspector at the time. The same helicopter was previously involved in a crash in Chile in 2010. In 2013, a pilot for the company was forced to land a helicopter carrying four passengers on the water near Manhattan after hearing a ¡°bang¡± that was followed by the ¡°Engine Out warning horn.¡± The pilot inflated the helicopter¡¯s floats and got the passengers to safety on a boat. ¡°The only thing I can tell you is that we are devastated,¡± Michael Roth, the CEO of the company operating the flight, told CNN of Thursday¡¯s crash. ¡°I¡¯m a father, a grandfather and my wife hasn¡¯t stopped crying since this afternoon.¡± When asked about the helicopter¡¯s maintenance, he said, ¡°That¡¯s something my director of maintenance handles.¡± The director of maintenance declined to comment. Maintenance records are not publicly accessible, and the NTSB restricts what companies can disclose during an ongoing investigation. ¡°(The pilot) called in that he was landing and that he needed fuel, and it should have taken him about three minutes to arrive, but 20 minutes later, he didn¡¯t arrive,¡± Roth told The Telegraph Thursday. The helicopter, a Bell 206L-4 LongRanger IV, was built in 2004 and held an airworthiness certificate issued in 2016 that was valid through 2029, according to Federal Aviation Administration records. Maintenance records are not public and during investigations NTSB rules prohibit companies from releasing certain information relating to the accident. The investigation into the cause of the crash will pore over documentation on all the work that was done on the aircraft. That would include the company¡¯s compliance with two recent FAA-issued airworthiness directives. One directive from May 2023, required the testing and possible replacement of tail rotor drive shafts on eight different Bell 206L models, including the 206L-4. That directive was prompted by an incident in which a Bell 206L helicopter experienced the loss of a tail-rotor drive due to a joint failure. The FAA also issued a December 2022 airworthiness directive on Bell 206L models with specific parts requiring inspection and possible replacement of the helicopters¡¯ main rotor blades because of ¡°delamination.¡± That refers to layers within the blade separating due to material fatigue, damage (from bird strikes, for example), or manufacturing errors, potentially leading the rotor blade to fail. It remains unclear whether any of these issues played a role in Thursday¡¯s crash. Both the FAA and the NTSB are investigating the crash. The NTSB has dispatched a ¡°go-team¡± to the site to examine the wreckage and review maintenance records, it said on social media, and is asking the public to submit any additional video or photos they may have. The helicopter was flying within New York¡¯s Special Flight Rules Area in New York, where air traffic control support is limited, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said in a post on X. Duffy added that the helicopter had received air traffic assistance from LaGuardia Airport shortly before entering the uncontrolled zone. This story has been updated with additional information.

Jersey City resident, Ipsitaa Banigrhi, described the sound as ¡°such a loud sound. It felt like thunder,¡± she told WCBS. ¡°Then I saw black particles flying. Again, I thought maybe it¡¯s just dust or birds, and then we heard all the emergency vehicles and sirens go by. I think that¡¯s when it was like, ¡®OK, what¡¯s happening.¡¯¡± With the helicopter¡¯s catastrophic failure in midair, there was no way to guide the aircraft to safety, a former combat pilot told CNN¡¯s Kate Bolduan. ¡°There¡¯s nothing that pilot could have done in that situation to recover the aircraft,¡± Brandt Anderson said. First responders from NYPD and New York City Fire Department teams pulled six people from the water. Four victims were pronounced dead at the scene, and two others succumbed to injuries shortly after, Tisch said. Two children were taken to Jersey City Medical Center, where they were later pronounced dead, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said on X. The aircraft¡¯s main fuselage was retrieved from the river on Thursday evening, and dive operations continued Friday, WCBS reported. The company operating the helicopter was previously involved in two safety incidents investigated by federal aviation authorities. In 2015, a pilot for the New York Helicopter Charter company was forced to land in New Jersey after hovering 20 feet in the air for a short time. An initial inspection showed there ¡°may have been corrosion removed¡± from sections of the helicopter and that some of the helicopter¡¯s component parts may have been deformed to an extent to be ¡°considered unairworthy,¡± according to an FAA inspector at the time. The same helicopter was previously involved in a crash in Chile in 2010. In 2013, a pilot for the company was forced to land a helicopter carrying four passengers on the water near Manhattan after hearing a ¡°bang¡± that was followed by the ¡°Engine Out warning horn.¡± The pilot inflated the helicopter¡¯s floats and got the passengers to safety on a boat. ¡°The only thing I can tell you is that we are devastated,¡± Michael Roth, the CEO of the company operating the flight, told CNN of Thursday¡¯s crash. ¡°I¡¯m a father, a grandfather and my wife hasn¡¯t stopped crying since this afternoon.¡± When asked about the helicopter¡¯s maintenance, he said, ¡°That¡¯s something my director of maintenance handles.¡± The director of maintenance declined to comment. Maintenance records are not publicly accessible, and the NTSB restricts what companies can disclose during an ongoing investigation. ¡°(The pilot) called in that he was landing and that he needed fuel, and it should have taken him about three minutes to arrive, but 20 minutes later, he didn¡¯t arrive,¡± Roth told The Telegraph Thursday. The helicopter, a Bell 206L-4 LongRanger IV, was built in 2004 and held an airworthiness certificate issued in 2016 that was valid through 2029, according to Federal Aviation Administration records. Maintenance records are not public and during investigations NTSB rules prohibit companies from releasing certain information relating to the accident. The investigation into the cause of the crash will pore over documentation on all the work that was done on the aircraft. That would include the company¡¯s compliance with two recent FAA-issued airworthiness directives. One directive from May 2023, required the testing and possible replacement of tail rotor drive shafts on eight different Bell 206L models, including the 206L-4. That directive was prompted by an incident in which a Bell 206L helicopter experienced the loss of a tail-rotor drive due to a joint failure. The FAA also issued a December 2022 airworthiness directive on Bell 206L models with specific parts requiring inspection and possible replacement of the helicopters¡¯ main rotor blades because of ¡°delamination.¡± That refers to layers within the blade separating due to material fatigue, damage (from bird strikes, for example), or manufacturing errors, potentially leading the rotor blade to fail. It remains unclear whether any of these issues played a role in Thursday¡¯s crash. Both the FAA and the NTSB are investigating the crash. The NTSB has dispatched a ¡°go-team¡± to the site to examine the wreckage and review maintenance records, it said on social media, and is asking the public to submit any additional video or photos they may have. The helicopter was flying within New York¡¯s Special Flight Rules Area in New York, where air traffic control support is limited, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said in a post on X. Duffy added that the helicopter had received air traffic assistance from LaGuardia Airport shortly before entering the uncontrolled zone. This story has been updated with additional information. CNN¡¯s Mark Morales, Alexandra Skores, Andy Rose, Tim Lister, Matt Stiles and Audrey Ash contributed to this report.

2025-04-12 09:27:21,780 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: Inflation slowed sharply in March, new data showed Thursday, underscoring the continued strength and resilience of the economy ahead of President Trump¡¯s aggressive trade moves. In any other timeline, such news would stoke optimism that Americans¡¯ cost of living is no longer surging. Instead, Thursday¡¯s Consumer Price Index report was likely another example of a ¡®what might have been¡¯ for the US economy. The latest reading of the Consumer Price Index ¡ª which showed inflation sharply cooling to an annual rate of 2.4% in March from 2.8% in February ¡ª lands as countries, businesses, markets and consumers grapple with America¡¯s most severe escalation of its tariff rate in more than a century. Economists have cautioned that Thursday¡¯s CPI report could very well mark the nadir in inflation this year as Trump¡¯s massive and sweeping tariffs upend global order and make imports ¡ª and, likely, end-products for consumers ¡ª markedly more expensive. ¡°If you consider a before and after snapshot, this is the ¡®before,¡¯¡± Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, told CNN in an interview. ¡°We may be whistling past the graveyard right now, because we know that costs are going to increase.¡± In March, prices fell 0.1% from the month before, a slower pace of growth than the 0.2% gain recorded in February, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Thursday. It¡¯s the first time that prices have fallen on a monthly basis since May 2020. Economists were expecting that falling energy prices would drive down the overall CPI rate to 0.1% for the month and 2.6% for the year, according to FactSet. The overall CPI index was driven lower by energy prices, which fell in part due to seasonal adjustments (prices typically go up in March but instead were muted due to growth and recession concerns). Still, a closely watched measurement of underlying inflation also showed substantial slowing. Alas, the slowing of inflation the March CPI showed will not be a telling indicator of the trajectory of prices to come, Frick said. ¡°Inflation was falling on its own,¡± he said. ¡°It appears as though we really were going to start heading back toward lower inflation.¡± That¡¯s probably not the case now, Frick said. ¡°We¡¯re likely going to be driving off a cliff here pretty soon,¡± he said. ¡°Let¡¯s not put blinders on, because the situation is still perilous for prices.¡± EY-Parthenon economists¡¯ latest model for the CPI ¡ª following Trump¡¯s Wednesday announcement of a 90-day pause on ¡®reciprocal¡¯ tariffs for many countries, the imposing of a 10% across-the-board tariff on imports, and the hiking of China¡¯s tariff rate to 125% ¡ª shows a rise of 0.8 percentage points this year. It was wholly expected that the March CPI report would feel a bit dated, because the lion¡¯s share of Trump¡¯s tariffs went into effect earlier this month. However, it also was likely that the latest CPI data would show how Trump¡¯s trade policies ¡ª and the early batch of imposed tariffs ¡ª were affecting the prices consumers pay for common goods and services. For example, the administration cheered falling oil and gas prices as signs that Trump¡¯s ¡°drill baby drill¡± policies were working; however, those prices fell amid a supply-demand imbalance as well as growth concerns weighing on crude prices, noted Wells Fargo economists. Additionally, airline fares tumbled 5.3% for the month and recreation prices showed an atypical dip, dropping 0.1%, suggesting that ¡°discretionary spending is cooling and leisure and entertainment venues are starting to respond,¡± James Knightley, chief international economist for ING, wrote in a note to clients Friday. Higher prices could kick off a chain reaction that no person nor economy wants to endure: Rising prices eat away at households¡¯ disposable incomes, which causes them to pull back on spending; business spending declines, and real GDP growth turns negative (the intensity of which depends on how much the trade war escalates); and the downturn in the economy results in rising unemployment. Goods prices, excluding food and energy, moved higher by 0.2% for the month, and apparel (a category heavily reliant on imports) climbed 0.7%. Energy and food prices can be quite volatile, but Thursday¡¯s report showed that underlying inflation cooled much more than economists expected. Core CPI, which strips out food and energy, rose just 0.1% for the month, resulting in a rate of 2.8% for the 12 months ended in March, marking a sharp slowdown from 3.1% in February. Core CPI is at its lowest rate in nearly four years. ¡°The decline in core inflation in March will definitely be welcomed by the Fed, particularly as it was evident in both core goods and services components,¡± Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings, said in commentary Friday. ¡°But we know firms had been sucking in huge amounts of imports in January and February in advance of tariff hikes, so the shock to consumer goods prices from tariff hikes is not reflected yet.¡± At the grocery store, food prices shot higher, increasing 0.5% from February, when prices held flat. Egg prices continued to climb for consumers as the industry still reels from a deadly bout of avian flu. The CPI egg index rose 5.9% from February and was up 60.4% annually. At the store level, the average price for a dozen grade A large eggs rose 5.6% to a new record of $6.23, BLS data shows. While the US Department of Agriculture has indicated in recent postings that wholesale prices are starting to fall as the avian flu is getting more under control, those declines weren¡¯t visible at the retail level last month. Shelter costs, which have been a persistent hurdle to overall inflation cooling, slowed in March to 0.2% from 0.3% and cooled to an annual rate of 4%, marking the lowest inflation rate for this major housing-related category since November 2021. All told, while Thursday¡¯s report is one the Federal Reserve would like to see, the central bank might be put in a bind if inflation were to reaccelerate and growth stagnates. ¡°The Fed remains in a tough spot, caught between a trade war causing tight financial conditions and weight on the economy as inflation takes off,¡± Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said in a statement.

2025-04-12 09:38:59,130 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: Americans are rarely this pessimistic about the economy. Consumer sentiment plunged 11% this month to a preliminary reading of 50.8, the University of Michigan said in its latest survey released Friday, the second-lowest reading on records going back to 1952. April¡¯s reading was lower than anything seen during the Great Recession. President Donald Trump¡¯s volatile trade war, which threatens higher inflation, has significantly weighed on Americans¡¯ moods these past few months. That malaise worsened leading up to Trump¡¯s announcement last week of sweeping tariffs, according to the survey. ¡°This decline was, like the last month¡¯s, pervasive and unanimous across age, income, education, geographic region and political affiliation,¡± Joanne Hsu, the survey¡¯s director, said in a release. ¡°Sentiment has now lost more than 30% since December 2024 amid growing worries about trade war developments that have oscillated over the course of the year,¡± she added. The Federal Reserve and Wall Street are watching closely how souring sentiment translates into consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of the US economy, and whether Americans lose faith that inflation will return to normal in the coming years. Trump on Wednesday paused his massive tariff hike on dozens of countries for 90 days, but kept in place a 10% baseline duty for all imports into the US and separate tariffs on specific products and commodities. The so-called reciprocal tariffs, albeit short lived, were the sharpest increase in US duties ever on data going back 200 years, Fitch Ratings told CNN China, however, wasn¡¯t included in Trump¡¯s tariff reprieve, continuing a contentious tit-for-tat between the world¡¯s two largest economies that stretched into Friday, with Beijing jacking up its retaliatory tariffs on US imports to 125% from 84%. The Michigan survey was fielded between March 25 and April 8, so it doesn¡¯t capture respondents¡¯ reaction to the recently announced tariff delay. In economics, surveys are referred to as ¡°soft data¡± and measures capturing actual economic activity, such as retail sales, are known as ¡°hard data.¡± The soft data has clearly deteriorated because of Trump¡¯s tariffs: The latest Michigan survey showed that ¡°the share of consumers expecting unemployment to rise in the year ahead increased for the fifth consecutive month and is now more than double the November 2024 reading and the highest since 2009,¡± according to a release.

Trump is trying to reinvent 1950 with his tariffs. He should be planning for 2050 Yet, the hard data still looks decent. Employers continue to hire at a brisk pace and shoppers haven¡¯t convincingly reined in their spending just yet, though retail sales have come in weaker than expected recently. ¡°Sometimes the surveys are very negative, but they keep spending,¡± Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week at an event near Washington, DC. ¡°People spent right through the pandemic and they spent right through this time of higher inflation.¡± Still, the hard data could take a turn for the worse. New York Fed President John Williams said Friday at an event in Puerto Rico that he expects economic growth to slow sharply this year, pushing up unemployment, and for inflation to accelerate. ¡°Given the combination of the slowdown in labor force growth due to reduced immigration and the combined effects of uncertainty and tariffs, I now expect real GDP growth will slow considerably from last year¡¯s pace, likely to somewhat below 1%,¡± he said. Spending by better-off Americans has played a key role in keeping the US economy humming along these past few years, but the recent turbulence on Wall Street, triggered by Trump¡¯s tariffs, is putting that under threat. ¡°Wealthy consumers¡¯ stock market gains kept the economy growing in 2024 despite high prices, but the wealthy won¡¯t feel confident enough to keep spending if this keeps up,¡± Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, wrote in a recent analyst note. Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world¡¯s largest asset manager, said Friday that today¡¯s dense fog of uncertainty, triggered by Trump¡¯s tariffs, is reminiscent of the 2008 global financial crisis. ¡°We¡¯ve seen periods like this before when there were large, structural shifts in policy and markets ¡ª like the financial crisis, Covid-19 and surging inflation in 2022. We always stayed connected with clients, and some of BlackRock¡¯s biggest leaps in growth followed,¡± Fink said. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon echoed that sentiment, noting Friday after the bank released its latest quarterly earnings: ¡°The economy is facing considerable turbulence (including geopolitics), with the potential positives of tax reform and deregulation and the potential negatives of tariffs and ¡®trade wars.¡¯¡± There¡¯s one survey-based measure that matters a whole lot for the Fed: Americans¡¯ perception of prices. It¡¯s critical because they can be self-fulfilling ¡ª if people expect inflation to climb and remain elevated in the long run, they adjust their spending accordingly. So far, that measure has been trending in the wrong direction: Expectations for inflation rates in the year ahead surged to 6.7% this month from 5% in March, the highest level since 1981, while expectations for the next five to 10 years climbed to 4.4% from 4.1%. If people do lose faith that inflation will ever get back to normal in the coming years, that would make it extremely difficult for the Fed¡¯s monetary policy to fight inflation. ¡°History teaches that when higher inflation expectations become entrenched, the road back to price stability is longer, the labor market is weaker and the economic scars are deeper,¡± Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said Thursday at an event in Dallas. Inflation expectations these days may be more susceptible than usual to becoming ¡°un-anchored,¡± since consumers just experienced a period of high inflation, leaving many Americans particularly sensitive to elevated prices.
2025-04-12 09:39:00,544 - Try_train - INFO - Found 10 articles for: Americans are rarely this pessimistic about the economy. Consumer sentiment plunged 11% this month to a preliminary reading of 50.8, the University of Michigan said in its latest survey released Friday, the second-lowest reading on records going back to 1952. April¡¯s reading was lower than anything seen during the Great Recession. President Donald Trump¡¯s volatile trade war, which threatens higher inflation, has significantly weighed on Americans¡¯ moods these past few months. That malaise worsened leading up to Trump¡¯s announcement last week of sweeping tariffs, according to the survey. ¡°This decline was, like the last month¡¯s, pervasive and unanimous across age, income, education, geographic region and political affiliation,¡± Joanne Hsu, the survey¡¯s director, said in a release. ¡°Sentiment has now lost more than 30% since December 2024 amid growing worries about trade war developments that have oscillated over the course of the year,¡± she added. The Federal Reserve and Wall Street are watching closely how souring sentiment translates into consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of the US economy, and whether Americans lose faith that inflation will return to normal in the coming years. Trump on Wednesday paused his massive tariff hike on dozens of countries for 90 days, but kept in place a 10% baseline duty for all imports into the US and separate tariffs on specific products and commodities. The so-called reciprocal tariffs, albeit short lived, were the sharpest increase in US duties ever on data going back 200 years, Fitch Ratings told CNN China, however, wasn¡¯t included in Trump¡¯s tariff reprieve, continuing a contentious tit-for-tat between the world¡¯s two largest economies that stretched into Friday, with Beijing jacking up its retaliatory tariffs on US imports to 125% from 84%. The Michigan survey was fielded between March 25 and April 8, so it doesn¡¯t capture respondents¡¯ reaction to the recently announced tariff delay. In economics, surveys are referred to as ¡°soft data¡± and measures capturing actual economic activity, such as retail sales, are known as ¡°hard data.¡± The soft data has clearly deteriorated because of Trump¡¯s tariffs: The latest Michigan survey showed that ¡°the share of consumers expecting unemployment to rise in the year ahead increased for the fifth consecutive month and is now more than double the November 2024 reading and the highest since 2009,¡± according to a release.

Trump is trying to reinvent 1950 with his tariffs. He should be planning for 2050 Yet, the hard data still looks decent. Employers continue to hire at a brisk pace and shoppers haven¡¯t convincingly reined in their spending just yet, though retail sales have come in weaker than expected recently. ¡°Sometimes the surveys are very negative, but they keep spending,¡± Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week at an event near Washington, DC. ¡°People spent right through the pandemic and they spent right through this time of higher inflation.¡± Still, the hard data could take a turn for the worse. New York Fed President John Williams said Friday at an event in Puerto Rico that he expects economic growth to slow sharply this year, pushing up unemployment, and for inflation to accelerate. ¡°Given the combination of the slowdown in labor force growth due to reduced immigration and the combined effects of uncertainty and tariffs, I now expect real GDP growth will slow considerably from last year¡¯s pace, likely to somewhat below 1%,¡± he said.

The better-than-expected Producer Price Index reading ¡ª which showed that the prices paid to producers fell 0.4% in March from the month before and slowed sharply to an annual rate of 2.7%, from 3.2% ¡ª provides a snapshot before President Donald Trump¡¯s aggressive trade policies fully kick in. Economists were expecting monthly prices to rise by 0.2% and to accelerate to 3.3% on an annual basis.

The sharp drop in overall PPI was partly attributable to broader concerns that the global economy will slow because of that drastic shift in US trading policy. The energy for final demand index sank 4% for the month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.

Trump¡¯s trade war escalates as China raises tariffs on US goods Egg prices paid to producers also dropped, reflecting some of the wholesale price declines that the US Department of Agriculture has noted in recent reports. Eggs for fresh use fell 21.3% in March but remain 165.4% higher from a year ago, according to the PPI data. While the PPI doesn¡¯t fully correlate to the prices consumers eventually pay, such a drop is an encouraging indication that egg prices could start to fall at the grocery store. PPI, which measures the average change in prices received by producers of goods and services, serves as a potential bellwether for retail-level inflation in the months ahead. This index also is being scrutinized to glean insight as to the initial impacts of Trump¡¯s sweeping new and proposed tariffs. March marked the second month that tariffs on Chinese goods were in effect (rising from 10% on all imports to 20% in early March); the global 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports went into effect on March 12. In April, Trump upped the ante on his tariff regime, including imposing an across-the-board 10% tariff on imports and a massive 145% duty on Chinese imports. Friday¡¯s PPI gave some hints as to how tariff-related price pressures could be percolating. Wholesale iron and steel mill prices jumped 7.1% in March, logging the biggest monthly jump since April 2021, when supply chains were on the fritz amid the sharp pandemic recovery. ¡°Metals manufacturing prices were up sharply in the March PPI, a sign the steel and aluminum tariffs were starting to bite,¡± Klachkin wrote. ¡°With tariffs only ramping up further recently, we expect to see more passthrough in future PPI data.¡±

ABCnews.com.co was a fake news website which mimicked the URL, design and logo of the ABC News website.[1][2] Many stories from ABCnews.com.co were widely shared before being debunked.[3]
The website's disclaimer page gave the address of the Westboro Baptist Church as its primary location.[4]
Paul Horner, the owner of the site, claimed to make $10,000 per month[a] from advertising traffic.[6][7]
In October 2017, ABCnews.com.co was shut down,[8] and its domain expired a few days later.[9]
Examples of fake news stories
[edit]ABCnews.com.co promulgated stories about prominent figures and organizations, including:

ABCnews.com.co was a fake news website which mimicked the URL, design and logo of the ABC News website.[1][2] Many stories from ABCnews.com.co were widely shared before being debunked.[3]
The website's disclaimer page gave the address of the Westboro Baptist Church as its primary location.[4]
Paul Horner, the owner of the site, claimed to make $10,000 per month[a] from advertising traffic.[6][7]
In October 2017, ABCnews.com.co was shut down,[8] and its domain expired a few days later.[9]
Examples of fake news stories
[edit]ABCnews.com.co promulgated stories about prominent figures and organizations, including:
- Anti-Trump protesters hired from Craigslist paid as much as $3,500[6][7]
- El Chapo escaped from Mexican prison again[10]
- President Barack Obama signed an order banning assault weapon sales[3]
- Michael Jordan intended to move the Charlotte Hornets out of North Carolina if the state did not revoke a law disallowing transgender people access to restrooms[11]
- The Supreme Court of the United States revoked the tax-exempt status of the Church of Scientology[12]

2025-04-12 11:36:36,175 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: What was a massive rally on Wall Street turned into yet another sizeable decline. Cheap stocks and hope for signs of trade negotiation sent markets surging Tuesday morning ¡ª but that relief rally evaporated as the White House said it would levy enormous tariffs on China. US stocks tumbled solidly into the red in the afternoon. The Dow fell 320 points, or 0.84%. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.57%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 2.15%. The S&P 500 closed at its lowest level in almost a year. The Dow and Nasdaq both closed at their lowest level since January 2024. Markets fell because President Donald Trump is set to impose an additional 84% in levies across all Chinese imports on Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced Tuesday. That will mean all goods from the country are subject to a tariff of at least 104%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq, which had surged as much as 4% and 4.5%, respectively, Tuesday morning, tumbled midday as Leavitt spoke to reporters. The loss for the Dow comes after the blue-chip index surged as much as 3.85% on Tuesday morning. At its lowest point of the day, the S&P 500 briefly dipped into bear market territory (down 20% from its record high in February) before pulling back and closing down 18.9% from that peak. It¡¯s the second day in a row the S&P 500 has flirted with bear territory. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq, firmly in a bear market since Friday, closed down 24.3% from its record high in December. The Dow closed down 16.4% from its record high in December. ¡°We¡¯re not anywhere out of the woods yet, and so that sort of tempers things,¡± said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments. Wall Street¡¯s fear gauge, the VIX index, surged higher Tuesday after spiking to historic levels the past two sessions, reflecting jitters among traders. ¡°Extreme fear¡± was the sentiment driving markets, according to CNN¡¯s Fear and Greed index. After markets plunged over the course of the past three trading sessions, Wall Street investors were looking for any excuse to catch their breath ahead of the planned tariff escalation at midnight ¡ª but Trump¡¯s hefty tariffs on China were a reminder that reprieve can be fleeting. Over the course of the past few days, stock prices got absolutely hammered as Wall Street grew fearful that Trump¡¯s tariff policy would plunge the US and global economies into a recession. After three days of market carnage, investors appeared to be seeking some buying opportunities. Related article
What to do if the stock market¡¯s big drop is getting to you One measure of the price-to-earnings ratio of S&P 500 companies closed below 17 Monday ¡ª historically cheap, giving investors a chance to scoop up stocks they believe might be oversold. ¡°This is a very normal action and very technical in nature after a shock period,¡± said Truist¡¯s Keith Lerner. ¡°The market is extremely oversold, and markets don¡¯t move in a linear fashion.¡± Lerner noted that historic market rebounds tend to be clustered in with massive declines, as investors with FOMO worry they could miss out on a rally. ¡°In a period of uncertainty, each bit of new information is overextrapolated, which leads to wider-than-normal-swings,¡± Lerner added. That explains why a bit of fake news Monday that Trump was considering a tariffs pause ¡ª immediately batted down by the White House ¡ª sent stocks temporarily surging. That gave markets a taste for what could happen if some nations begin to make progress in negotiating lower tariffs. ¡°Yesterday market players saw how the hint of ¡®good news¡¯ ¡ª in that case it was chatter about a pause in the Liberation Day tariffs ¡ª could rally markets by whole percentage points very quickly,¡± Michael Block of Third Seven Capital said in a note to investors. ¡°Even though that proved to be all smoke, traders are now poised for the fire ¨C that is, real news.¡± Investors have been on edge for any updates from the White House that might signal Trump is negotiating his trade policy. White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Tuesday on Fox News that the administration is managing ¡°a massive number of requests for negotiations¡± from nations and that Trump is prioritizing ¡°two of our closest allies and trading partners,¡± Japan and South Korea. Earlier on Tuesday, Trump posted on social media that he had ¡°a great call with the Acting President of South Korea.¡± On Monday, Trump spoke with Japan¡¯s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who will be sending a team to visit Washington to negotiate a trade deal. ¡°(Traders) are peeking around every corner looking for even the slightest whiff of a trade deal or movement on the tariff front,¡± said Jamie Cox, managing director at Harris Financial group. ¡°The market is wound up for a face-ripping rally.¡± Across the Atlantic, The European Union¡¯s executive arm said the bloc is prepared to negotiate with the United States over buying more of its liquefied natural gas. It¡¯s a response to a grievance raised Trump, who has said the EU must buy around $350 billion worth of American LNG to compensate for the deficit the US has in goods trade with the bloc.

US trade official defends Trump¡¯s tariffs, says almost 50 countries approached him to ¡®explore how to achieve reciprocity¡¯ US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said Tuesday during a routine hearing before the Senate Finance Committee that the administration is in talks with about 50 countries and that they¡¯re trying to address some non-tariff related measures, such as foreign countries¡¯ regulations that impede US exports. Greer reaffirmed that Trump¡¯s massive reciprocal tariffs will go into effect Wednesday. ¡°We will have the president¡¯s plan go into effect, and we¡¯re coupling that with immediate negotiations with our partners,¡± he said. Markets tried to rebound Tuesday before sliding. It¡¯s a reminder that there¡¯s no guarantee stocks will remain buoyant. After imposing across-the-board 10% tariffs on virtually all products coming into the United States Saturday, the Trump administration is set to impose significantly steeper levies still on dozens of countries. Those tariffs, which Trump has called ¡°reciprocal,¡± although they are no such thing, amount to as much as 50% for a handful of countries. China¡¯s Commerce Ministry on Tuesday said the country would ¡°fight to the end¡± of the trade war and would continue to stand up to Trump. The escalating trade war between the two largest economies is turning into a high-stakes game of chicken. China has squashed deals that Trump wants ¡ª including a US company taking control of ports on both sides of the Panama Canal and a deal to sell TikTok to a US-based company. Both countries¡¯ economies would be hurt in a trade war ¡ª and given the massive trade imbalance with the United States, China could very well be hurt worse. So investors hopeful for a deal may not get one. And if they don¡¯t, a damaging trade war could bring down both economies ¡ª and markets along with them. Any escalation of the trade war would probably lead to a US and global recession this year, multiple Wall Street banks have said over the course of the past week, including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase. That could continue to sap demand for stocks. Although the current bounce back may be short-lived, some in the Trump administration were already declaring victory. ¡°It¡¯s finding the bottom now. It¡¯s finding the bottom now,¡± Trump¡¯s top trade adviser Peter Navarro said about the market Monday evening on Fox News. ¡°It¡¯s going to shift over and it¡¯s going to be companies in the S&P 500 who are the first to produce here. Those are the ones going to lead to recovery. And it¡¯s going to happen. Dow 50,000. I guarantee that and I guarantee no recession.¡± Navarro¡¯s optimism wasn¡¯t matched by JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who warned in his annual letter to shareholders Monday that Trump¡¯s tariffs would raise prices, slow the global economy and weaken America¡¯s standing in the world by tearing up its alliances. Even some of Trump¡¯s allies, including Elon Musk and Bill Ackman, have recently warned that tariffs are bad policy that rely on extremely flawed logic. CNN¡¯s Phil Mattingly, Bryan Mena, Elisabeth Buchwald, James Frater, Anna Cooban and Juliana Liu contributed to this report.

2025-04-12 11:46:46,737 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: The US stock market tumbled deeply into the red on Thursday as the White House clarified its plan for a massive 145% tariff on China, escalating a trade war. The Dow, after rising nearly 3,000 points Wednesday, had a volatile day in the red on Thursday. The blue-chip index fell 1,015 points, or 2.5%, pulling back after tumbling as much as 2,100 points midday. The S&P 500 fell 3.46% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 4.31%. The S&P 500 was coming off its best day since 2008, and the Nasdaq on Wednesday posted its second-best daily gains in history. The stock market, fresh off its third-best day in modern history, is sinking back into reality: Although President Donald Trump paused most of his ¡°reciprocal¡± tariffs, his other massive import taxes have already inflicted significant damage, and the economy won¡¯t easily recover from the fallout. After taking a victory lap Wednesday, the president on Thursday acknowledged some ¡°transition problems¡± could be expected. ¡°A big day yesterday. There will always be transition difficulty ¡ª but in history, it was the biggest day in history, the markets. So we¡¯re very, very happy with the way the country is running. We¡¯re trying to get the world to treat us fairly,¡± Trump said in the Cabinet Room. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar¡¯s strength against six foreign currencies, tumbled 1.7% Thursday, hitting its lowest level since early October. The dollar has broadly weakened this year, a sign of investors¡¯ concern about the health and stability of the US economy. Gold prices hit a fresh record high above $3,170 a troy ounce on Thursday. The yellow metal is considered a safe haven amid economic and geopolitical turmoil and just posted its best quarter since 1986. Traders were elated that Trump temporarily rescinded his so-called reciprocal tariffs, which aren¡¯t really reciprocal, for 90 days. Those tariffs placed hefty levies between 11% and 50% on dozens of countries. Stock futures on Thursday had also responded somewhat positively to the European Union¡¯s announcement that it would temporarily pause its retaliatory tariffs on the United States in hopes of a negotiated trade agreement after Trump¡¯s U-turn. Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said more than 70 countries were lining up to negotiate trade deals with the United States to get out from under the tariffs, and the Trump administration wanted to provide time to strike deals.

Hear a financial planner¡¯s top three tips But even after Trump¡¯s about-face, the reality remains stark: Economists said the economic damage is done, and many say there is still an elevated risk of a US and global recession. Stocks are still well below where they were before Trump unveiled his ¡°Liberation Day¡± tariffs last week, and those large stock market losses, existing tariffs and high degree of uncertainty about American trade policy are enough to sink the economy, they say. Trump¡¯s universal 10% tariff that went into effect Saturday remains in place, as do 25% tariffs on auto imports, 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum and 25% tariffs on some goods from Canada and Mexico. Trump also pledged to go forward with additional tariffs on pharmaceuticals, lumber, semiconductors and copper. Goldman Sachs said Wednesday after Trump¡¯s partial detente that recession chances in the United States were still a coin flip. JPMorgan Wednesday evening said the bank would not alter its recession forecasts, still seeing a 60% chance of a US and global recession even after Trump¡¯s ¡°positive¡± decision to unwind his ¡°draconian¡± country-specific tariffs. ¡°My sense here is that the (US) economy is still likely to fall into recession, given the level of simultaneous shocks that it¡¯s absorbed,¡± Joe Brusuelas, chief economist of consulting firm RSM, told CNN. ¡°All this does is postpone temporarily what will likely be a series of punitive import taxes put on US trade allies.¡± The CBOE Volatility Index, or Wall Street¡¯s fear gauge, surged 40% Thursday. The VIX briefly traded above 50 points midday ¡ª a rare level associated with extreme volatility. New data on Thursday showed that inflation in the US slowed sharply in March.

Meanwhile, Trump isn¡¯t backing off his alarming trade war with China ¡ª in fact, it¡¯s getting worse. Goods coming from China to the United States are now subject to at least a 145% tariff, the White House clarified Thursday. The 125% ¡°reciprocal¡± tariff Trump announced on China on Wednesday comes on top of the 20% tariff that had already been in place. It hadn¡¯t been clear if the tariffs were additive. Stocks immediately dipped lower after news outlets began reporting the clarification around 11 a.m. ET. Also on Thursday, Beijing¡¯s retaliatory 84% tariffs on US imports to China went into effect. China says it remains willing to negotiate with the United States, but a spokesperson for the Chinese Commerce Ministry also reiterated Thursday that China will not back down if Trump chooses to further escalate the trade war. ¡°The door to talks is open, but dialogue must be conducted on the basis of mutual respect and equality,¡± the spokesperson said. ¡°We hope the US will meet China halfway, and work toward resolving differences through dialogue and consultation.¡± ¡°If the US chooses confrontation, China will respond in kind. Pressure, threats and blackmail are not the right ways to deal with China,¡± the spokesperson said. Some billionaire investors, who have been pressuring Trump to back off his punishing tariffs, were elated that the president hit pause. ¡°There are better and worse ways of handling our problems with unsustainable debt and imbalances, and President Trump¡¯s decision to step back from a worse way and negotiate how to deal with these imbalances is a much better way,¡± billionaire investor Ray Dalio said in a post on X late Wednesday, adding: ¡°I hope¡­ he will do the same with the Chinese.¡± But signs of stress remain in markets beyond just stocks.

2025-04-12 11:47:54,742 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: US stocks skyrocketed higher after President Donald Trump announced that he authorized a 90-day pause on the ¡°reciprocal¡± tariffs that had gone into effect Wednesday, with the exception of China. Wall Street had been on edge, looking for any sign that Trump might shift his approach to his punitive tariffs. So when Trump posted on social media that he authorized a pause on most reciprocal tariffs, investors were ready to dive in. US stocks immediately surged, posting a historic rally. The Dow skyrocketed 2,963 points, or 7.87%. The S&P 500 shot up 9.52%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq soared 12.16%. In a massive turnaround, the S&P 500 posted its best day since October 2008. It was also the third-best day for the benchmark index since its modern-day version was formed in 1957. The Nasdaq posted its best day since January 2001 and its second-best day in its history. The Dow posted its best day in five years. ¡°The market¡¯s move upward is violent, and speaks to how badly the market was looking for clarity on this issue,¡± said Chris Brigati, chief investment officer at SWBC, an investment firm in San Antonio, Texas. Related article
Trump announces 90-day pause on ¡®reciprocal¡¯ tariffs with exception of China The positive shift was widespread. Nearly every single company in the S&P 500 rose, according to data from FactSet. Amazon (AMZN) rose 11.98%. Nike (NKE) gained 11.36%. Meanwhile, United Airlines (UAL) soared 26.14%, Delta Air Lines (DAL) surged 23.38% and American Airlines (AAL) surged 22.6%. On the Nasdaq, Apple (AAPL) surged 15.33%. Nvidia (NVDA) rose 18.72%. Palantir (PLTR) gained 19%. Tesla (TSLA) surged 22.69%. The S&P 500 is now up 12.86% from its nadir reached two days ago, but is still down more than 3.7% from its close on April 2, right before Trump initially announced his ¡°reciprocal¡± tariffs. The Nasdaq is still 2.7% down from its close on April 2. Before the upward swing, the S&P 500 had been on the precipice of bear market territory, coming close to a stunningly rapid drop of 20% from the all-time high it hit just seven weeks ago on February 19. The S&P closed down 11.2% from its record high in February. Following Trump¡¯s announcement, investors scooped up stocks and markets soared. Yet uncertainty remains as Trump still escalated the trade war with China, raising its tariff rates to 125% from 104%. Additionally, universal duties of 10% remain on all US imports alongside the targeted, sectoral tariffs on autos. Wall Street breathed a sigh of relief as markets rallied, but investors are not necessarily in the clear. ¡°Trump illustrated to everyone in the market today how incredibly difficult it is to trade around his tariff regime, because he and only he knows when it ends,¡± said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group. Just after the opening bell on Wednesday, Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social: ¡°BE COOL!¡± and ¡°This is a great time to buy!!!¡± In an exchange with CNN¡¯s Alayna Treene on Wednesday, Trump declined to say if the markets were ultimately what prompted his reversal on tariffs. ¡°The markets right now are extremely good,¡± he said. US stocks initially had a mixed start to the day after China announced significant retaliation and the European Union announced countermeasures against Trump¡¯s reciprocal tariffs that had gone into effect earlier in the day. However, markets surged after Trump announced that all countries ¡ª besides China ¡ª subjected to reciprocal tariff rates would see rates go back down to the universal 10% rate. China, an extreme outlier, now faces a US tariff of at least 125%, compounding the new tariffs with ones already in place. Trump touted the market reaction to the announcement in a hot-mic moment at the White House Wednesday that was captured by CNN pool. Trump, greeting lawmakers at a NASCAR event on the White House South Lawn, was approached by Wyoming Senator John Barrasso who told him: ¡°You got the markets seeing your brilliance.¡± ¡°Yeah, that¡¯s up almost 7 (percentage) points, 2500 points, nobody¡¯s ever heard of it. It¡¯s gonna be a record,¡± Trump said in reply. Fear has gripped investors across the world as the escalating trade war threatens to throw the global and US economies into a recession this year. Businesses and consumers will end up footing tariff bills, and uncertainty has led to a slowdown in hiring and consumer spending. Earlier in the day, global markets had fallen. Japan¡¯s Nikkei index closed 4% down, while Hong Kong¡¯s Hang Seng finished marginally higher. On Monday, the Hang Seng tanked in a 13% rout ¨C the biggest daily decline for the index since the 1997 Asian financial crisis. South Korea¡¯s benchmark Kospi index headed into bear market territory on Wednesday, a decline of 20% from a recent peak, after the country announced $1.3 billion in emergency support measures for its auto industry as it seeks to mitigate the impact of the Trump administration¡¯s tariffs. The index closed down 1.7%, falling about 20% from a peak reached in July 2024. Markets in Taiwan also fell sharply. The Shanghai stock market closed more than 1% higher, an outlier in a sea of red in Asia on Wednesday. In Europe, the region¡¯s benchmark STOXX 600 index fell 3.5%. France¡¯s CAC index was down 3.34% and Germany¡¯s DAX was 3% lower. London¡¯s FTSE 100 index was 2.92% lower. US oil reversed course and gained Wednesday after tumbling earlier in the day. US oil gained 4.65% to $62.35 a barrel after it had tumbled as low as $57 a barrel. The global benchmark Brent crude gained 4.23% to $65.48 a barrel, reversing course after it had briefly fallen below $60 a barrel. Both had hit their lowest level since 2021 before surging higher after Trump¡¯s announcement. Oil prices had plunged as investors feared a potential global recession could sap demand for travel, transportation and shipping ¡ª all of which require fuel. Investors have poured money into some traditional safe-havens, such as gold. Gold spot prices rose more than 3%. But, curiously, US Treasury yields have risen in recent days as investors have largely sold off bonds. The benchmark 10-year yield, which fell below 4% earlier in the week, is now above 4.3%. Bonds were volatile on Wednesday, with yields coming down slightly from their intraday high but settling above recent sessions. Bonds yields and prices trade in opposite directions. Typically, in times of crisis, investors pour money into longer-term bonds in hopes that the short-term market problems are solved in the long run. But the bond market, like the stock market, has been shaken by extreme volatility in recent days, and some investors are heading for the exits. Trump told reporters Wednesday he was watching volatility in the bond market in recent days, appearing to indicate that it was among the factors that led to his decision to institute a 90-day pause on some tariffs. ¡°I was watching the bond market. The bond market is very tricky. I was watching it. But if you look at it now, it¡¯s beautiful. The bond market right now is beautiful. But yeah, I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy,¡± he said. Deutsche Bank analysts on Wednesday said the mass exodus from Treasury bonds may signal weakening demand for US-backed assets ¡ª traditionally viewed as the gold standard for safety, because it has the backing of the US government. But in a trade war, investors may be fearful that America could lose its special standing in the world ¡ª an opinion echoed by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon in his shareholder letter earlier this week. And foreign governments negotiating with Trump on trade may threaten to sell off their massive Treasury hoards, hurting America¡¯s ability to borrow money to pay for its significant budget deficit. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar¡¯s strength against six foreign currencies, pared its losses after initially sliding on Wednesday. The dollar has broadly weakened this year ¡ª a potential warning sign about waning investor confidence in the United States. The CBOE volatility index, also known as the ¡°VIX¡± and Wall Street¡¯s ¡°fear gauge,¡± sank 35.75% after Trump¡¯s announcement of a pause on most reciprocal tariffs, reflecting easing jitters among traders. The VIX Wednesday morning had briefly surpassed 50 points ¡ª a level associated with extreme volatility ¡ª before sinking in the afternoon to just above 33 points. The index had closed above 50 on Tuesday, a level reached only twice before this week: During the early stages of the Covid pandemic in March and April 2020 and the 2008-2009 financial crisis that brought on the so-called Great Recession. The VIX is perhaps the best-known measure of market sentiment. It measures expected price fluctuations or volatility in the S&P 500 Index options over the next 30 days. The VIX often surges on days when the broader market sinks ¡ª and rallies when stocks rise. But over time, the VIX tends to be lower in bull markets and higher when the bears are in control. Volatility works in both directions, and this week is a good example. The market bounced and tanked and surged as news ¡ª and even some fake news Monday ¡ª about Trump¡¯s potential plans for tariffs made its way through Wall Street. While Trump¡¯s announcement of a pause on most reciprocal tariffs was welcome news for investors, uncertainty lingers as a trade war with China looms. ¡°The US and China are now locked into a trade war without either likely to back down at the moment,¡± Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown told CNN. ¡°What you¡¯re seeing in investors being extremely skittish which is why (there are) big fluctuations.¡± CNN¡¯s DJ Judd, Kevin Liptak, Betsy Klein, Elisabeth Buchwald, James Frater and Christian Edwards contributed reporting

So when Trump posted on social media that he authorized a pause on most reciprocal tariffs, investors were ready to dive in. US stocks immediately surged, posting a historic rally. The Dow skyrocketed 2,963 points, or 7.87%. The S&P 500 shot up 9.52%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq soared 12.16%. In a massive turnaround, the S&P 500 posted its best day since October 2008. It was also the third-best day for the benchmark index since its modern-day version was formed in 1957. The Nasdaq posted its best day since January 2001 and its second-best day in its history. The Dow posted its best day in five years. ¡°The market¡¯s move upward is violent, and speaks to how badly the market was looking for clarity on this issue,¡± said Chris Brigati, chief investment officer at SWBC, an investment firm in San Antonio, Texas.

Trump announces 90-day pause on ¡®reciprocal¡¯ tariffs with exception of China The positive shift was widespread. Nearly every single company in the S&P 500 rose, according to data from FactSet. Amazon (AMZN) rose 11.98%. Nike (NKE) gained 11.36%. Meanwhile, United Airlines (UAL) soared 26.14%, Delta Air Lines (DAL) surged 23.38% and American Airlines (AAL) surged 22.6%. On the Nasdaq, Apple (AAPL) surged 15.33%. Nvidia (NVDA) rose 18.72%. Palantir (PLTR) gained 19%. Tesla (TSLA) surged 22.69%. The S&P 500 is now up 12.86% from its nadir reached two days ago, but is still down more than 3.7% from its close on April 2, right before Trump initially announced his ¡°reciprocal¡± tariffs. The Nasdaq is still 2.7% down from its close on April 2. Before the upward swing, the S&P 500 had been on the precipice of bear market territory, coming close to a stunningly rapid drop of 20% from the all-time high it hit just seven weeks ago on February 19. The S&P closed down 11.2% from its record high in February. Following Trump¡¯s announcement, investors scooped up stocks and markets soared. Yet uncertainty remains as Trump still escalated the trade war with China, raising its tariff rates to 125% from 104%. Additionally, universal duties of 10% remain on all US imports alongside the targeted, sectoral tariffs on autos. Wall Street breathed a sigh of relief as markets rallied, but investors are not necessarily in the clear. ¡°Trump illustrated to everyone in the market today how incredibly difficult it is to trade around his tariff regime, because he and only he knows when it ends,¡± said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group. Just after the opening bell on Wednesday, Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social: ¡°BE COOL!¡± and ¡°This is a great time to buy!!!¡± In an exchange with CNN¡¯s Alayna Treene on Wednesday, Trump declined to say if the markets were ultimately what prompted his reversal on tariffs. ¡°The markets right now are extremely good,¡± he said. US stocks initially had a mixed start to the day after China announced significant retaliation and the European Union announced countermeasures against Trump¡¯s reciprocal tariffs that had gone into effect earlier in the day. However, markets surged after Trump announced that all countries ¡ª besides China ¡ª subjected to reciprocal tariff rates would see rates go back down to the universal 10% rate. China, an extreme outlier, now faces a US tariff of at least 125%, compounding the new tariffs with ones already in place. Trump touted the market reaction to the announcement in a hot-mic moment at the White House Wednesday that was captured by CNN pool. Trump, greeting lawmakers at a NASCAR event on the White House South Lawn, was approached by Wyoming Senator John Barrasso who told him: ¡°You got the markets seeing your brilliance.¡± ¡°Yeah, that¡¯s up almost 7 (percentage) points, 2500 points, nobody¡¯s ever heard of it. It¡¯s gonna be a record,¡± Trump said in reply. Fear has gripped investors across the world as the escalating trade war threatens to throw the global and US economies into a recession this year. Businesses and consumers will end up footing tariff bills, and uncertainty has led to a slowdown in hiring and consumer spending. Earlier in the day, global markets had fallen. Japan¡¯s Nikkei index closed 4% down, while Hong Kong¡¯s Hang Seng finished marginally higher. On Monday, the Hang Seng tanked in a 13% rout ¨C the biggest daily decline for the index since the 1997 Asian financial crisis. South Korea¡¯s benchmark Kospi index headed into bear market territory on Wednesday, a decline of 20% from a recent peak, after the country announced $1.3 billion in emergency support measures for its auto industry as it seeks to mitigate the impact of the Trump administration¡¯s tariffs. The index closed down 1.7%, falling about 20% from a peak reached in July 2024. Markets in Taiwan also fell sharply. The Shanghai stock market closed more than 1% higher, an outlier in a sea of red in Asia on Wednesday. In Europe, the region¡¯s benchmark STOXX 600 index fell 3.5%. France¡¯s CAC index was down 3.34% and Germany¡¯s DAX was 3% lower. London¡¯s FTSE 100 index was 2.92% lower. US oil reversed course and gained Wednesday after tumbling earlier in the day. US oil gained 4.65% to $62.35 a barrel after it had tumbled as low as $57 a barrel. The global benchmark Brent crude gained 4.23% to $65.48 a barrel, reversing course after it had briefly fallen below $60 a barrel. Both had hit their lowest level since 2021 before surging higher after Trump¡¯s announcement. Oil prices had plunged as investors feared a potential global recession could sap demand for travel, transportation and shipping ¡ª all of which require fuel. Investors have poured money into some traditional safe-havens, such as gold. Gold spot prices rose more than 3%. But, curiously, US Treasury yields have risen in recent days as investors have largely sold off bonds. The benchmark 10-year yield, which fell below 4% earlier in the week, is now above 4.3%. Bonds were volatile on Wednesday, with yields coming down slightly from their intraday high but settling above recent sessions. Bonds yields and prices trade in opposite directions. Typically, in times of crisis, investors pour money into longer-term bonds in hopes that the short-term market problems are solved in the long run. But the bond market, like the stock market, has been shaken by extreme volatility in recent days, and some investors are heading for the exits. Trump told reporters Wednesday he was watching volatility in the bond market in recent days, appearing to indicate that it was among the factors that led to his decision to institute a 90-day pause on some tariffs. ¡°I was watching the bond market. The bond market is very tricky. I was watching it. But if you look at it now, it¡¯s beautiful. The bond market right now is beautiful. But yeah, I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy,¡± he said. Deutsche Bank analysts on Wednesday said the mass exodus from Treasury bonds may signal weakening demand for US-backed assets ¡ª traditionally viewed as the gold standard for safety, because it has the backing of the US government. But in a trade war, investors may be fearful that America could lose its special standing in the world ¡ª an opinion echoed by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon in his shareholder letter earlier this week. And foreign governments negotiating with Trump on trade may threaten to sell off their massive Treasury hoards, hurting America¡¯s ability to borrow money to pay for its significant budget deficit. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar¡¯s strength against six foreign currencies, pared its losses after initially sliding on Wednesday. The dollar has broadly weakened this year ¡ª a potential warning sign about waning investor confidence in the United States. The CBOE volatility index, also known as the ¡°VIX¡± and Wall Street¡¯s ¡°fear gauge,¡± sank 35.75% after Trump¡¯s announcement of a pause on most reciprocal tariffs, reflecting easing jitters among traders. The VIX Wednesday morning had briefly surpassed 50 points ¡ª a level associated with extreme volatility ¡ª before sinking in the afternoon to just above 33 points. The index had closed above 50 on Tuesday, a level reached only twice before this week: During the early stages of the Covid pandemic in March and April 2020 and the 2008-2009 financial crisis that brought on the so-called Great Recession. The VIX is perhaps the best-known measure of market sentiment. It measures expected price fluctuations or volatility in the S&P 500 Index options over the next 30 days. The VIX often surges on days when the broader market sinks ¡ª and rallies when stocks rise. But over time, the VIX tends to be lower in bull markets and higher when the bears are in control. Volatility works in both directions, and this week is a good example. The market bounced and tanked and surged as news ¡ª and even some fake news Monday ¡ª about Trump¡¯s potential plans for tariffs made its way through Wall Street. While Trump¡¯s announcement of a pause on most reciprocal tariffs was welcome news for investors, uncertainty lingers as a trade war with China looms. ¡°The US and China are now locked into a trade war without either likely to back down at the moment,¡± Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown told CNN. ¡°What you¡¯re seeing in investors being extremely skittish which is why (there are) big fluctuations.¡± CNN¡¯s DJ Judd, Kevin Liptak, Betsy Klein, Elisabeth Buchwald, James Frater and Christian Edwards contributed reporting

What I¡¯m gonna do is make sure that we have good science so that people can make an informed choice.¡± A measles outbreak spanning multiple states is nearing 600 cases, and experts say it might just be the beginning. As of Tuesday, Texas has reported 505 cases associated with the outbreak, New Mexico has reported 56 cases, and Oklahoma has reported 10: eight confirmed and two probable.

Response to multistate measles outbreak hampered by unique set of challenges The outbreak began in rural Gaines County, Texas, where most of the cases are concentrated, but Tuesday¡¯s update shows spread into 21 Texas counties. Local officials are particularly worried about spread of the measles virus into new areas and vulnerable populations, such as urban centers. ¡°I¡¯m worried about exposures in grocery stores, malls and those types of places that don¡¯t exist as much out in the rural community,¡± Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock Public Health, said Tuesday. ¡°You have a much bigger population, so one case can be exposing a lot more individuals.¡± In these areas, public health workers will need to do more to figure out who is at risk, who is exposed and who needs to isolate, she said. Some local health departments have said that recent cuts to funding from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will hinder their epidemiology work and lab capacity for identifying measles cases. In Lubbock, measles exposure in a day care center has resulted in seven cases in children under the age of 5, Wells said Tuesday. This is a particularly vulnerable community, as many of the children are not old enough to get their second dose of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Under normal circumstances, the CDC recommends one dose of MMR between 12 to 15 months of age and another between 4 and 6 years. In outbreak situations, these guidelines may be updated.

¡®Measles is only a plane flight away¡¯: As outbreak surges, experts warn against global health funding cuts ¡°Our biggest challenge right now is really around younger children,¡± Wells said. ¡°One of my biggest concerns was outbreaks in places where we have vulnerable individuals, individuals that can¡¯t be vaccinated yet, or children that are undervaccinated because they¡¯re only eligible for that one vaccine.¡± The local health department is encouraging vaccination for other children at the day care center, in line with recommendations from the Texas Department of Health Services that children ages 1 to 4 in the outbreak area get their second dose as soon as possible, as long as it¡¯s at least 28 days after their first dose. Infants who are 6 to 11 months in the outbreak area can get an early dose of the MMR vaccine and will then resume the normal MMR schedule with two more doses. Given the contagious nature of the virus and low vaccination rates in many pockets of the country, experts expect the outbreak to grow, possibly for more than a year. Continued spread of the virus for more than 12 months could threaten the measles elimination status the US earned in 2000, according to the CDC. ¡°I think it is going to be something that really pushes us to the deadline for elimination for the United States, as well as for the Americas,¡± Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said Tuesday. Compared with other recent US outbreaks, cases are vastly undercounted in this outbreak, he said, in part because it has been concentrated in a Mennonite population that is undervaccinated. ¡°There might be reticence to get tested in some of those areas, [which] probably means that this is a lot bigger than the outbreaks that we¡¯ve seen in the past,¡± Adalja said. Three deaths have been connected with the outbreak: two school-age children in Texas and an adult in New Mexico whose death remains under investigation. All of these people were unvaccinated.

But Trump¡¯s 90-day pause on his ¡°reciprocal¡± tariffs that were never actually reciprocal gives his administration just three months to strike enormously complex trade deals with dozens of countries that it says are lining up to negotiate. Financial markets aren¡¯t buying it. Stocks have whipsawed as volatility has spiked. And other markets, including oil, bonds and the dollar, are sending a clear message of deep skepticism that Trump will be able to pull this one off. Following another steep sell-off Thursday, stocks appeared calmer ¡ª for now ¡ª and posted strong gains Friday. Related article
Wall Street is seeing right through the Trump 2.0 spin The Dow ended the day higher by 619 points, or 1.56%. The S&P 500 rose 1.81% and the Nasdaq was 2.06% higher. Markets were buoyed by Boston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins telling the Financial Times Friday that the central bank would step in to support financial markets if there were signs of distress. But stock market investors have been trading on a knife¡¯s edge, and any announcement coming from the Trump administration on tariffs has the ability to send stocks surging or tumbling. For example, stocks plunged Thursday after the Trump administration clarified the math it had already used to set China¡¯s massive 145% tariff. The street had believed the tariff was 125%. The Dow sank sharply, at one point falling more than 2,000 points. In the 129-year history of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the index has closed higher or lower by at least 1,000 points just 31 times. Four of those times happened in the past week. The S&P 500 fell by just over 9% across the first week of April, its biggest one-week drop since March 2020. The benchmark index gained 5.7% this week, its biggest one-week gain since 2023. Despite Wednesday¡¯s historic gain after Trump announced his detente, stocks remain well below where they were trading before the president presented his ¡°Liberation Day¡± tariff plan on April 2. The bond market is acting weirdly. Typically, you¡¯d expect bond prices to rise throughout periods of turmoil. US Treasuries are historically considered to be the safest of safe assets, backed up by the full faith and credit of the US government. But bonds aren¡¯t rising ¡ª they¡¯re falling. That¡¯s largely because investors have lost faith in US trade policy, and they fear America could get hurt even worse than the countries Trump¡¯s tariff policy is targeting. As JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in his annual letter to shareholders Monday, Trump¡¯s ¡°America First¡± policy risks alienating its most important partners and the country¡¯s special standing in the world.

The bond market is acting weird. It spooked Trump US Treasury yields, which trade in opposite direction to prices, briefly surged on Friday above 4.5%. They were under 4% earlier in the week. That represents a massive move for the market. Higher yields could hurt America¡¯s economy, as a number of consumer loans are closely tied to those rates. ¡°The upward action in rates has been rapid in historical context and has provided no comfort to investors looking for havens in turbulent markets,¡± analysts at Citi said in a Friday note. US Treasuries were on track for their worst week since 2019, according to Bloomberg¡¯s US Treasury total return index, when the New York Federal Reserve had to step in and purchase Treasuries to bring down a spike in yields caused by a liquidity crunch. ¡°Current market conditions don¡¯t require Fed intervention at this point, but Fed officials are likely monitoring market function closely,¡± said Chip Hughey, managing director for fixed income at Truist Advisory Services. Dimon said Friday on an earnings call that he expects there will be a ¡°kerfuffle¡± in the Treasury markets that would lead to the Federal Reserve intervening. ¡°They¡¯re not going to do it now ¡­ they¡¯ll do it when they start to panic a little bit,¡± Dimon said. The oil market has been trading like we¡¯re going into a recession. Prices have tumbled over the course of the past couple of weeks as investors feared Trump¡¯s trade policy could sap demand for travel, shipping and transportation ¡ª all of which require fuel. US oil on Friday morning fell below $60 a barrel, close to a four-year low, before recovering slightly. Brent, the global benchmark, was hovering around $63 a barrel, the lowest since April 2021, before also gaining slightly. Oil gained on Friday after US Energy Secretary Chris Wright told reporters that the US could stop Iran¡¯s oil exports as part of Trump¡¯s negotiations over the nation¡¯s nuclear program, according to Reuters. US oil settled up 2.4% at $61.50 a barrel. Brent rose 2.26% to $64.76 a barrel. Yet concerns remain about the impact of tariffs on economic growth and how a potential slowdown could disrupt demand for oil. Oil prices have served as a prime recession indicator in recent years. Prices tumbled after surging above $100 a barrel for the first time as the Great Recession took hold in 2008. And prices went negative for the first time during the pandemic as a glut of oil became so severe that traders were literally paying storage facilities to take the unwanted oil off their hands. The dollar on Friday tumbled to its lowest level in three years. That¡¯s the opposite of what you¡¯d expect when tariffs are put in place. Typically, tariffs raise the value of a local currency, because it encourages residents to purchase homemade goods instead of foreign options, stretching their money further in comparison to other currencies. But currency traders have sold off the dollar, because they believe America will bear the brunt of Trump¡¯s trade war fallout and end up comparatively weaker than before tariffs were put in place. The dollar on Friday hit its lowest level against the euro since 2022. The dollar index ¡ª which measures the dollar against a basket of currencies ¡ª fell 0.9% Friday after tanking 2% Thursday, which was its worst single-day drop since 2022. Those are massive moves in currency trading world. ¡°Investors and central banks are selling Treasuries and dollars due to a loss of confidence and credibility in American assets,¡± said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist RSM. ¡°Financial chaos has its cost.¡± Meanwhile, gold prices surged above a record high $3,200 a troy ounce on Friday. Gold is up more than 23% this year and just posted its best quarter since 1986. The yellow metal is considered a safe haven amid economic and political uncertainty. Despite financial markets casting enormous doubt that the Trump administration can salvage the opportunity it created for itself to strike bilateral trade agreements with all 150 countries around the world, the Trump administration remains optimistic. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said this week that more than 70 countries have asked to meet with US representatives to strike a deal that could get them out from under the thumb of Trump¡¯s punishing tariffs. Although the administration has provided few details of which countries it is negotiating with, it said it would favor allies like South Korea and Japan first. Related article
Xi says China ¡®not afraid¡¯ as Beijing raises tariffs on US goods to 125% in latest escalation of trade war But trade deals are incredibly complex arrangements usually negotiated over the course of years, not months. And even if Trump were to negotiate trade with all those countries over a short period ¡ª whether full deals or letters of agreement that put a framework of a deal together ¡ª China, the world¡¯s biggest exporter, remains the elephant in the room. US tariffs on China are now at at least 145% and China on Friday retaliated with 125% tariffs of its own. That will do enormous damage to the world¡¯s two largest economies, and both sides have said they are not eager to back down. China has consistently said it is open to negotiations, but wants to do it in a way in which it will be respected. China has ignored America¡¯s warnings not to raise its tariffs, according to a source familiar with the discussions. In the meantime, economists have been unmoved by Trump¡¯s sudden change in tune. Although negotiated trade agreements would undoubtedly be good news for the economy, much of the damage has already been done, Wall Street economists have argued. And punishing 10% universal tariffs remain in place, as do 25% tariffs on autos, 25% tariffs on some goods from Mexico and Canada, and 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum. That¡¯s why JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs say the likelihood of the United States and the global economies going into a recession this year are basically a coin flip.

Their respective intentions to bid for the 2031 and 2035 editions are alone in the contests after a first deadline to enter the race passed. The first formal bid documents must be signed by the end of April. FIFA President Gianni Infantino told European soccer officials the governing body received one expression of interest to host the 2031 event ¡ª from the US with the possibility of other countries in the CONCACAF region joining the project.

Netflix purchases US broadcasting rights for next two FIFA Women¡¯s World Cups ¡°We look forward to sharing more details and unveiling our full vision for the 2031 FIFA Women¡¯s World Cup in the near future,¡± the US Soccer Federation said in a statement. FIFA has just one ¡°valid bid¡± to host the 2035 event, from the British member federations centered on England, Infantino said at UEFA¡¯s annual meeting in Belgrade, Serbia. ¡°Hosting the first FIFA World Cup since 1966 with our home nations partners will be very special,¡± English FA CEO Mark Bullingham said. ¡°The hard work starts now, to put together the best possible bid by the end of the year.¡± The UK¡¯s interest was quickly supported last month by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer when FIFA said it was formally seeking bids from member federations. FIFA excluded Europe from the 2031 contest, clearing the way for a long-expected US win. Spanish soccer officials said last week they hoped to bid, possibly with Portugal and Morocco in a repeat of the co-hosting plan for the men¡¯s 2030 World Cup. It was unclear why Spain did not then meet Monday¡¯s deadline set by FIFA to express interest in bidding. Infantino¡¯s comments to the annual meeting of UEFA seemed to rule out a Spain bid now being allowed. ¡°So the path is there for the Women¡¯s World Cup to be taking place in ¡¯31 and ¡¯35 in some great countries,¡± the FIFA president said, ¡°to boost even more the women¡¯s football movement.¡± FIFA is scheduled to confirm Women¡¯s World Cup hosts next year. The 2027 edition with 32 teams is being hosted by Brazil. The Women¡¯s World Cup would return to the US for the first time since the 2003 edition. The US also hosted in 1999. England hosted the Women¡¯s European Championship in 2022 ¡ª which the home team won ¡ª and the men¡¯s Euro 2028 will be co-hosted by England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland. In a further boost for women¡¯s soccer, Infantino detailed FIFA¡¯s plan to have more women¡¯s teams than men¡¯s playing at the next Olympics. There were just 12 teams in the women¡¯s tournament at the 2024 Paris Olympics and 16 in the men¡¯s tournament. Though the International Olympic Committee strongly supports gender equality at the games, adding four more women¡¯s teams ¡ª and about 70 extra players, plus team officials ¡ª would push the limit of agreed athlete quotas for organizers in Los Angeles. Infantino said on Thursday that FIFA¡¯s new proposal is to flip the numbers to have 16 women¡¯s teams and 12 in the men¡¯s tournaments. The final decision is for the IOC, which has an executive board meeting next Wednesday.

Infantino¡¯s comments to the annual meeting of UEFA seemed to rule out a Spain bid now being allowed. ¡°So the path is there for the Women¡¯s World Cup to be taking place in ¡¯31 and ¡¯35 in some great countries,¡± the FIFA president said, ¡°to boost even more the women¡¯s football movement.¡± FIFA is scheduled to confirm Women¡¯s World Cup hosts next year. The 2027 edition with 32 teams is being hosted by Brazil. The Women¡¯s World Cup would return to the US for the first time since the 2003 edition. The US also hosted in 1999. England hosted the Women¡¯s European Championship in 2022 ¡ª which the home team won ¡ª and the men¡¯s Euro 2028 will be co-hosted by England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland. In a further boost for women¡¯s soccer, Infantino detailed FIFA¡¯s plan to have more women¡¯s teams than men¡¯s playing at the next Olympics. There were just 12 teams in the women¡¯s tournament at the 2024 Paris Olympics and 16 in the men¡¯s tournament. Though the International Olympic Committee strongly supports gender equality at the games, adding four more women¡¯s teams ¡ª and about 70 extra players, plus team officials ¡ª would push the limit of agreed athlete quotas for organizers in Los Angeles. Infantino said on Thursday that FIFA¡¯s new proposal is to flip the numbers to have 16 women¡¯s teams and 12 in the men¡¯s tournaments. The final decision is for the IOC, which has an executive board meeting next Wednesday.

2025-04-12 17:04:19,468 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: Less than a day after the Supreme Court said the Trump administration had to ¡°facilitate¡± the return of a man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, the case appeared headed for even murkier waters. During a tense hearing before US District Judge Paula Xinis on Friday afternoon, Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign repeatedly stonewalled the judge as she sought to nail down details about the steps the administration is taking to secure the return of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, at one point even admitting he had no information to provide on exactly where the Maryland father of three currently is. ¡°I¡¯m not asking for state secrets,¡± Xinis said after Ensign told her he didn¡¯t have basic details on where Abrego Garcia is. ¡°I¡¯m asking a very simply question: Where is he?¡± ¡°There is no evidence today as to where he is today,¡± the judge said later. ¡°That is extremely troubling.¡± Xinis on Friday ordered the Justice Department to provide daily updates on what the administration is doing to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia, but it remains unclear whether the reports would prove satisfactory to either the court or the lawyers representing Abrego Garcia and his family. The judge did not say what would happen if she didn¡¯t like the answers. Here¡¯s what to know about the case: The Trump administration has conceded that it mistakenly deported him ¡°because of an administrative error,¡± but maintains it cannot bring him back because he is in Salvadoran custody. Abrego Garcia was granted protected status by an immigration judge in 2019 that prohibited the federal government from sending him to El Salvador. His attorneys say he fled gang violence in El Salvador more than a decade ago. Abrego Garcia had been identified by his wife in a photo of detainees entering intake at El Salvador¡¯s notorious mega-prison CECOT last month. Officials with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement say he is a member of MS-13, which the Trump administration has designated as a foreign terrorist organization. Xinis had initially ordered the administration to return Abrego Garcia to the US last Friday, calling the mistaken deportation an ¡°illegal act,¡± and setting a midnight April 7 deadline. Related article
Supreme Court says Trump must ¡®facilitate¡¯ return of man mistakenly deported to El Salvador The administration quickly appealed her order, first to the federal appeals court based in Richmond and then, when the intermediate court hadn¡¯t yet ruled, to the Supreme Court, which put the deadline on hold while it considered the case. The high court on Thursday backed Xinis¡¯ order but did not give the administration a deadline for when Abrego Garcia should be returned, saying instead that the district court judge¡¯s directive was unclear and needed clarification. Importantly, the Supreme Court noted that the clarification needed to be made with ¡°due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs.¡± Hours later, Xinis issued a new order for the government to ¡°take all available steps to facilitate¡± Abrego Garcia¡¯s return and directed it to provide her with a sworn statement from an individual ¡°with personal knowledge¡± of the steps the government has taken or is planning to take to secure his return. But attorneys with the Justice Department told the judge on Friday morning that they needed more time to provide the sworn declaration, blowing past two deadlines she gave the department to file it. She ruled later Friday that the administration ¡°failed to comply¡± with her order for the information, saying it ¡°made no meaningful effort to comply.¡± President Donald Trump said Friday night that he would bring back Abrego Garcia if the Supreme Court ordered him to do so. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on the way to Florida, Trump was asked about the case, and he said, ¡°If the Supreme Court said bring somebody back, I would do that. I respect the Supreme Court.¡± Asked about Judge Xinis and her order earlier Friday, Trump said, ¡°Well, I¡¯m not talking about the lower court. I have great respect for the Supreme Court.¡± Trump told reporters, ¡°I don¡¯t know which one,¡± appearing to concede that he was not familiar with the details of this specific case, ¡°but if they said to bring him back, I would tell them to bring him back.¡± The president¡¯s comments appear directly at odds with what the Justice Department attorney argued in Maryland earlier in the day. During the brief hearing Friday, Xinis, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, appeared incredulous as Ensign failed to answer her questions about the case, including their failure to meet her deadline for submitting the declaration. ¡°The record as it stands ¡­ is your clients have done nothing to facilitate the return of Mr. Abrego Garcia,¡± the judge said. She pushed back strongly on the government¡¯s argument that the Supreme Court order required her to first hear from the Justice Department before pushing ahead in the case and ordered up the daily updates to keep close tabs on how the administration was following her order. ¡°We¡¯re not going to slow walk this,¡± Xinis said. ¡°So you will have a full and fair opportunity to be heard, but we¡¯re not relitigating what the Supreme Court has already put to bed.¡± The judge said the updates must come in the form of a sworn statement from an individual with personal knowledge of the situation. The individual must answer a series of questions the judge has already posed to the government, including ¡°the current physical location and custodial status of Abrego Garcia ¡­ what steps, if any, Defendants have taken to facilitate Abrego Garcia¡¯s immediate return to the United States¡± and ¡­ ¡°what additional steps Defendants will take, and when, to facilitate his return.¡± ¡°I hope you will in good faith comply,¡± she told Ensign, adding that even if the answer is that the government has no information to provide, she wants to know that every day. ¡°It¡¯s important to go on record in a case of this nature,¡± the judge said. The filing is due by 5 p.m. ET each day. The judge hasn¡¯t said when she would stop requiring the submissions. While Xinis¡¯ homework for attorneys representing Abrego Garcia did not include daily court filings, she told them they are free to inform her of the harms they think are continuing in the case, as well as any ¡°relief¡± they might ask for if they think the government isn¡¯t complying with her order. But the judge stopped short of agreeing to quickly issue a follow-up order requiring the government¡¯s compliance with her earlier directive, indicating that she instead preferred Abrego Garcia¡¯s attorneys to request such an order if they saw fit. ¡°(The) court¡¯s order was sufficiently clear,¡± Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Abrego Garcia¡¯s attorneys, told the judge at one point. ¡°They clearly didn¡¯t comply.¡± Sandoval-Moshenberg also lambasted what he saw as the administration¡¯s decision to send a lawyer to the hearing who has ¡°no personal knowledge¡± on the status of Abrego Garcia. ¡°It is quite clear that the government, and I hate to use these words, is playing a game with their lawyers,¡± he told Xinis. During the initial hearing in the case last week, the DOJ attorney who appeared before Xinis on behalf of the administration expressed frustration at not being able to answer key questions from the judge. That attorney, Erez Reuveni, was quickly placed on administrative leave because of the admission, according to two people familiar with the matter. This story has been updated with additional details. CNN¡¯s Priscilla Alvarez, Evan Perez and Sam Waldenberg contributed to this report.

Importantly, the Supreme Court noted that the clarification needed to be made with ¡°due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs.¡± Hours later, Xinis issued a new order for the government to ¡°take all available steps to facilitate¡± Abrego Garcia¡¯s return and directed it to provide her with a sworn statement from an individual ¡°with personal knowledge¡± of the steps the government has taken or is planning to take to secure his return. But attorneys with the Justice Department told the judge on Friday morning that they needed more time to provide the sworn declaration, blowing past two deadlines she gave the department to file it. She ruled later Friday that the administration ¡°failed to comply¡± with her order for the information, saying it ¡°made no meaningful effort to comply.¡± President Donald Trump said Friday night that he would bring back Abrego Garcia if the Supreme Court ordered him to do so. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on the way to Florida, Trump was asked about the case, and he said, ¡°If the Supreme Court said bring somebody back, I would do that. I respect the Supreme Court.¡± Asked about Judge Xinis and her order earlier Friday, Trump said, ¡°Well, I¡¯m not talking about the lower court. I have great respect for the Supreme Court.¡± Trump told reporters, ¡°I don¡¯t know which one,¡± appearing to concede that he was not familiar with the details of this specific case, ¡°but if they said to bring him back, I would tell them to bring him back.¡± The president¡¯s comments appear directly at odds with what the Justice Department attorney argued in Maryland earlier in the day. During the brief hearing Friday, Xinis, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, appeared incredulous as Ensign failed to answer her questions about the case, including their failure to meet her deadline for submitting the declaration. ¡°The record as it stands ¡­ is your clients have done nothing to facilitate the return of Mr. Abrego Garcia,¡± the judge said. She pushed back strongly on the government¡¯s argument that the Supreme Court order required her to first hear from the Justice Department before pushing ahead in the case and ordered up the daily updates to keep close tabs on how the administration was following her order. ¡°We¡¯re not going to slow walk this,¡± Xinis said. ¡°So you will have a full and fair opportunity to be heard, but we¡¯re not relitigating what the Supreme Court has already put to bed.¡± The judge said the updates must come in the form of a sworn statement from an individual with personal knowledge of the situation. The individual must answer a series of questions the judge has already posed to the government, including ¡°the current physical location and custodial status of Abrego Garcia ¡­ what steps, if any, Defendants have taken to facilitate Abrego Garcia¡¯s immediate return to the United States¡± and ¡­ ¡°what additional steps Defendants will take, and when, to facilitate his return.¡± ¡°I hope you will in good faith comply,¡± she told Ensign, adding that even if the answer is that the government has no information to provide, she wants to know that every day. ¡°It¡¯s important to go on record in a case of this nature,¡± the judge said. The filing is due by 5 p.m. ET each day. The judge hasn¡¯t said when she would stop requiring the submissions. While Xinis¡¯ homework for attorneys representing Abrego Garcia did not include daily court filings, she told them they are free to inform her of the harms they think are continuing in the case, as well as any ¡°relief¡± they might ask for if they think the government isn¡¯t complying with her order. But the judge stopped short of agreeing to quickly issue a follow-up order requiring the government¡¯s compliance with her earlier directive, indicating that she instead preferred Abrego Garcia¡¯s attorneys to request such an order if they saw fit. ¡°(The) court¡¯s order was sufficiently clear,¡± Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Abrego Garcia¡¯s attorneys, told the judge at one point. ¡°They clearly didn¡¯t comply.¡± Sandoval-Moshenberg also lambasted what he saw as the administration¡¯s decision to send a lawyer to the hearing who has ¡°no personal knowledge¡± on the status of Abrego Garcia. ¡°It is quite clear that the government, and I hate to use these words, is playing a game with their lawyers,¡± he told Xinis. During the initial hearing in the case last week, the DOJ attorney who appeared before Xinis on behalf of the administration expressed frustration at not being able to answer key questions from the judge. That attorney, Erez Reuveni, was quickly placed on administrative leave because of the admission, according to two people familiar with the matter. This story has been updated with additional details. CNN¡¯s Priscilla Alvarez, Evan Perez and Sam Waldenberg contributed to this report.

2025-04-12 17:05:26,880 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: After some rain overnight softened up the course, the scoring conditions were ideal for Friday¡¯s second round at the Masters. And many of the world¡¯s best golfers were ready to take advantage. Following a masterful opening round at Augusta National, round one leader Justin Rose came back to earth on Friday, allowing much of the field to move within striking distance heading to the weekend. Rose shot a very respectable round of 71, but had too many bogeys mixed in with his handful of birdies. However, the 44-year-old Englishman has many on his tail including Bryson DeChambeau and Rory McIlroy. DeChambeau, a two-time major winner, started out the second round scorched earth and continued on to finish the day at 4-under par, sitting one stroke behind Rose for the lead. Related article
Bryson DeChambeau says nothing is better than a major win ¨C but nailing a hole-in-one over his house was pretty close The Northern Irishman, McIlroy, had a disastrous back nine in Thursday¡¯s first round but did a total 180 on Friday, carding a 6-under par that leaves him just two shots from the lead. Rose welcomed the opportunity to go against some of the best world. ¡°That¡¯s the company that I expect to keep, and that¡¯s where I have tried to be my whole career,¡± Rose said to reporters after the round. ¡°That¡¯s where I¡¯ve been for a lot of my career. So I¡¯ve been a Top-10 player in the world for a decade or more. So yeah, this is nice to, obviously, yeah, be back in that mix, a hundred percent.¡± Rose and DeChambeau will tee off at 2:40 p.m. ET on Saturday while McIlroy will get started 10 minutes earlier. McIlroy and DeChambeau headline the crop of stars to remain in the hunt for the iconic green jacket. The 35-year-old¡¯s quest for a maiden Masters win and a career grand slam appeared dead following Thursday¡¯s multiple double-bogeys that saw him fall from second to 27th on the leaderboard. After Friday¡¯s astonishing play from McIlroy, he talked about the reset needed to get back into contention. ¡°Once I left the property last night, I just sort of tried to leave what had happened here. You know, I rushed out of here to get home to see Poppy before she went to bed. So that was sort of nice to get to see her before she went to sleep,¡± McIlroy said. ¡°Yeah, I guess that¡¯s something that I didn¡¯t have a few years ago, to be able to get home and have that sort of, you know, take my mind off the golf a little bit. But yeah, I just ¨C I feel like I just did a good job of resetting.¡± DeChambeau, the LIV Golf star, for the second straight day looked like a man on a mission. The 31-year-old spoke on the confidence he has in winning golf¡¯s most prestigious event. ¡°I¡¯d always say, to win it takes a little bit of luck and a great amount of skill set. I feel like my skill set is the same, if not a little bit better in certain aspects,¡± DeChambeau said. ¡°So I¡¯m just going to give it my absolute best, and whatever happens, happens. And I¡¯m okay with whatever does happen. Because ultimately, it¡¯s not ¨C it¡¯s not everything but it would be amazing to win. It¡¯s just more, continue to keep putting myself in positions like this.¡± Amongst the others still vying for a win sees Canadian Corey Conners, who sits tied for third place at 6-under par. Multiple golfers including Tyrell Hatton, Matt McCarty, Shane Lowry and world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler sit at tied for fifth on the leaderboard. Scheffler finds himself in unfamiliar territory, three strokes back of the leader Rose after an inconsistent second round. After a bogey-free Thursday, the 28-year-old bogeyed four holes in the back nine including on the 18th hole that found him ducking and diving the magnolia trees that saw him getting to his knees to knock his ball back into the fairway. ¡°Golf is a funny game. It¡¯s a day-to-day thing. Yesterday I felt really sharp. Today not as sharp. Could the conditions have contributed to that? I¡¯m sure a little bit,¡± Scheffler said. ¡°That¡¯s what¡¯s great about this golf course is it¡¯s quite challenging and you get winds like that, you¡¯ve really got to manage your expectations, manage yourself around the course. Sometimes I did a good job of that. Other times today, maybe not so good.¡± Scheffler is eyeing becoming the first golfer to win back-to-back Masters since Tiger Woods in 2002 and it won¡¯t be an easy road for him going into the weekend in Augusta, Georgia. But if theres one thing Scheffler knows how to do, thats make a comeback and will try to do so starting at 2:10 p.m. ET on Saturday. His final Masters might have not ended the way he would have liked but Bernhard Langer got the send off one can only dream off. The two-time Masters champion missed the cut after bogeying the 18th hole to put him at 3-over par for the weekend, just narrowingly missing the +2 cut line and etching his name in history as the oldest player to make the Masters cut, a record Fred Couples set in 2023. The 67-year-old previously announced it would be his final Masters after playing in the tournament 41 times prior. Following the final hole, Langer took off his visor and saluted the applauding crowd at Augusta National. He was then met by Augusta National chairman Fred Ridley before catching up with his family and walking into the clubhouse a final time. ¡°There were lots of standing ovations throughout the golf course in various spots. Today coming up 18 was mixed emotions because I was still inside the cut line, and even when I made bogey, I wasn¡¯t sure I¡¯m totally out of there or not because I actually thought 3-over would make the cut, as windy as it was today,¡± Langer said. ¡°So there were lots of emotions flooding through my mind the last two days as I was walking down the fairways. I saw my wife, I saw my four kids, and I saw two of my grandkids came out and supported me, and friends from Germany and family from Germany. Just even friends from all over the world, literally, were walking a few holes with me. It meant a great deal.¡± Among Langer - Brooks Koepka, Tony Finau, Keegan Bradley and Couples did not make it to the weekend at the tournament. Tom Kim will get the third round of the 2025 Masters started, teeing off at 9:50 a.m.ET on Saturday and the tournament runs through Sunday.

2025-04-12 17:08:09,137 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: Every golfer is chasing the elation of a major tournament victory, but Bryson DeChambeau has found something that almost compares: Sinking a hole-in-one over his house. Last November, the reigning and two-time US Open champion embarked on a wildly entertaining challenge. He lined the ball up in his driveway and launched it blind over the roof, hoping it would find its way into the bottom of the cup on the green in his back yard. On the first day, he allowed himself one shot, the next day, saying, ¡°This is ridiculous,¡± he took two swings, and so on, until his 14th shot on the 16th day. On his 134th attempt, when he finally made it, DeChambeau ran whooping onto the green. He rolled on the turf, picked out the ball, kissed it and threw it into the air, shouting, ¡°Let¡¯s go, baby!¡± Asked by CNN to compare the joy of a major victory with this most unusual accomplishment, DeChambeau smiled. ¡°I was definitely excited! I had the adrenaline running through my body, chills in my body, because I knew it was going to be a cool piece of content,¡± he explained. ¡°Not as cool as winning a major championship, but it¡¯s up there. I¡¯d say it¡¯s 90% there.¡± Millions of fans had been following his challenge, which went viral online. They¡¯d witnessed agonizingly close calls at the end of the first week and four days later they saw the ball hit the lip on one occasion and bounce out of the hole on another, as DeChambeau discovered another way to share his love of the game with the world. When he burst onto the scene in 2015, DeChambeau was known as the Golf Scientist. A physics major from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, he seemed to be obsessed with finding an original way to succeed in the game. In 2015, he became only the fifth player to win both the NCAA and US Amateur titles in the same year, joining the likes of Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson in an elite group of legendary achievers. Once on the PGA Tour, everybody was keen to peek into his golf bag to see the iron set that he¡¯d engineered to be all the same length, and he¡¯d share stories about dunking his balls in salt water to check that they¡¯d been correctly balanced. But the curiosity in him became uncomfortable when he was criticized for slow play and a feud developed with compatriot Brooks Koepka. By 2019, DeChambeau had become a polarizing figure in the game and ¨C despite winning the US Open Championship in 2020 ¨C he endured further stinging judgement when he left the PGA Tour and joined LIV two years later. Speaking to the media ahead of his ninth Masters appearance, DeChambeau admitted that he¡¯d been hurt by the criticism earlier in his career. ¡°I was very sensitive to it,¡± he said. ¡°There was a time where it was definitely more difficult to hear. I think as time has gone on, you realize that we¡¯re all human and it¡¯s OK if somebody has a perspective. You just try to show through your actions what you¡¯re doing for this great game of golf.¡± ¡°I don¡¯t want to be just known for winning a bunch of tournaments,¡± he added, ¡°I want to be known for entertaining and inspiring and hopefully growing the game in some capacity. That¡¯s all I focus on now.¡± So, DeChambeau sought to take control of his own image, launching a YouTube channel to engage with his fans and showcase his personality. Three years later, he¡¯s posted almost 200 videos, which have been viewed almost 300 million times. On the hallowed grounds of Augusta National, DeChambeau at first seemed reluctant to discuss his role as a content creator, but he said that he¡¯d be interested in shooting segments about the history of arguably the most revered golf course in the world. But the thought has crossed his mind that maybe his video content has become a distraction for his day job as a competitive golfer. ¡°There are times I¡¯ve gotten a little overzealous and been like, ¡®Wow, I need to focus on my game a little bit,¡¯¡± he said. ¡°But sometimes the content I create actually helps me focus for the next week.¡± DeChambeau admits that if he¡¯s shooting a quirky challenge with an economy set of clubs from Amazon or Walmart it won¡¯t help him before a major tournament, but if the whole point of a video feature is to shoot a low score, then it probably will aid his preparation. ¡°I¡¯ve got to absolutely play my best golf if I¡¯m going to break the course record,¡± he said, ¡°So it gets me in that mentality. I¡¯m really strategizing and planning what¡¯s going to work best for me. But I certainly love it, I won¡¯t stop. I¡¯ll continue to do it because I think it¡¯s hopefully inspiring for people.¡± In the meantime, DeChambeau returns to his day job this week as a serious tournament player. Despite now being a multiple-time major champion, he says he gets nervous during the competition, but he still finds joy in such pressured situations. And if he can triumph in The Masters, he¡¯ll have a new green jacket to wear in his videos for the next 12 months. You can bet the house on it.
2025-04-12 17:08:11,072 - Try_train - INFO - Found 10 articles for: Every golfer is chasing the elation of a major tournament victory, but Bryson DeChambeau has found something that almost compares: Sinking a hole-in-one over his house. Last November, the reigning and two-time US Open champion embarked on a wildly entertaining challenge. He lined the ball up in his driveway and launched it blind over the roof, hoping it would find its way into the bottom of the cup on the green in his back yard. On the first day, he allowed himself one shot, the next day, saying, ¡°This is ridiculous,¡± he took two swings, and so on, until his 14th shot on the 16th day. On his 134th attempt, when he finally made it, DeChambeau ran whooping onto the green. He rolled on the turf, picked out the ball, kissed it and threw it into the air, shouting, ¡°Let¡¯s go, baby!¡± Asked by CNN to compare the joy of a major victory with this most unusual accomplishment, DeChambeau smiled. ¡°I was definitely excited! I had the adrenaline running through my body, chills in my body, because I knew it was going to be a cool piece of content,¡± he explained. ¡°Not as cool as winning a major championship, but it¡¯s up there. I¡¯d say it¡¯s 90% there.¡± Millions of fans had been following his challenge, which went viral online. They¡¯d witnessed agonizingly close calls at the end of the first week and four days later they saw the ball hit the lip on one occasion and bounce out of the hole on another, as DeChambeau discovered another way to share his love of the game with the world. When he burst onto the scene in 2015, DeChambeau was known as the Golf Scientist. A physics major from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, he seemed to be obsessed with finding an original way to succeed in the game. In 2015, he became only the fifth player to win both the NCAA and US Amateur titles in the same year, joining the likes of Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson in an elite group of legendary achievers.

2025-04-13 04:15:53,601 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: A sightseeing helicopter plunged into the Hudson River on Thursday, turning a family outing above Manhattan¡¯s misty skyline into a tragedy. The helicopter carried six people, including three children and their parents ¨C who have both worked for Siemens, a German multinational technology conglomerate. It lifted off from a Manhattan heliport and followed a familiar route: circling the Statue of Liberty, gliding north along the Hudson toward the George Washington Bridge and then turning south. About 16 minutes after takeoff, the aircraft crashed into the water, according to analysis by CNN and FlightRadar24. Witnesses described the helicopter flipping and spiraling before crashing near the New Jersey shoreline upside down, scattering debris across the river. ¡°The helicopter was a little bit like nose down, slightly, and I saw the propeller separating from the helicopter. It kept spinning in the air alone. Nothing was attached to it,¡± Sarah Jane Raymond Ryer, who saw the crash unfold, told CNN affiliate WCBS. A video obtained by CNN shows the rotor blades detached from the helicopter and flying through the air. ¡°The videotape in this case is very dramatic and very important to the investigation,¡± former National Transportation Safety Board managing director Peter Goelz told CNN on Friday. Eyewitness Avi Rakesh told CNN¡¯s Jessica Dean that what was left of the helicopter appeared to be so out of control, he didn¡¯t feel safe in his own building. ¡°Debris was flying everywhere. I was concerned that something might come and hit the window,¡± Rakesh said. Here¡¯s what we know about the crash that killed everyone on board: The victims include Agust¨ªn Escobar, 49, his wife, Merc¨¨ Camprub¨ª Montal, and their three children - two sons, ages 4 and 11, along with a daughter who was to turn 9 on Friday. New York City Mayor Eric Adams said the family was visiting from Spain, and Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said in a social media post that the family was in New York to celebrate Camprub¨ª¡¯s 40th birthday. ¡°I want to (say) that they left together,¡± Joan Camprub¨ª, whose sister was killed in the crash, said at a news conference on Saturday. ¡°They left without suffering, and they left with a smile on their faces. And that¡¯s important for us as a family. We want to remind and honor their happiness and their smiles forever.¡± ¡°We want to move the bodies as soon as possible, home, back home ¡­ with all the family to rest in peace together in our place,¡± Camprub¨ª added. Escobar served as CEO of Rail Infrastructure at Siemens Mobility, the transportation solutions division of Siemens AG. ¡°We are deeply saddened by the tragic helicopter crash in which Agustin Escobar and his family lost their lives. Our heartfelt condolences go out to all their loved ones,¡± a Siemens Mobility spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. Spain¡¯s Prime Minister, Pedro S¨¢nchez, expressed his condolences, calling the incident ¡°an unimaginable tragedy.¡± Merc¨¨ Camprub¨ª Montal was the global commercialization manager for Siemens Energy, according to her LinkedIn page. Siemens Energy is an independent company that was spun off from Siemens AG in 2020. ¡°We are deeply saddened and shocked by the loss of a colleague due to a tragic accident during vacation,¡± said a statement from Siemens Energy. ¡°Our thoughts and heartfelt condolences go out to the family, friends and colleagues of the victims.¡± In addition to her international corporate career, Camprub¨ª is known in Spain as a member of a prominent sports family. Camprub¨ª¡¯s grandfather and great-grandfather both served as presidents of FC Barcelona, one of the most popular soccer clubs in the world. The pilot was identified as 36-year-old Seankese Johnson, according to city officials. He was certified to fly commercial helicopters since August 2023, according to FAA records, and the NTSB noted he had completed 788 hours in the air. A friend of Johnson, helicopter pilot Matt Klier, told CNN affiliate WABC he was ¡°an amazing pilot.¡± ¡°He was just a super good dude,¡± Klier said, holding back tears. ¡°I¡¯m a helicopter pilot, we started at the same time. The man was an amazing pilot.¡± Mayor Adams spoke about Johnson at the news conference on Saturday after dropping off flowers in the water in honor of those who were killed. ¡°He was a Navy SEAL,¡± Adams said. ¡°He fought to defend this country, and we want to acknowledge him and his wife, Kathryn, for her loss, and our prayers are with all of the family members involved, and no words can fill the void, the loss.¡± ¡°Their sorrow is our sorrow,¡± Adams said. ¡°New York City is a family, and we consider this (as) a loss of our family members with unexpected pain and suffering.¡± The cause of the crash remains unclear, but its sudden descent stunned witnesses as first responders raced to rescue the victims. The helicopter took off at 2:59 p.m. from Manhattan¡¯s downtown heliport following a popular sightseeing route, New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. After circling the Statue of Liberty, it flew north along the Hudson River, reaching the George Washington Bridge by 3:08 p.m. It then turned south along the New Jersey shoreline, where it lost control shortly after, Tisch said.

A Siemens exec, his family and their pilot are dead after helicopter crashes into the Hudson River Visibility at the time was 10 miles, though the region was cloudy with winds of 10 to 15 mph and gusts up to 25 mph. A weather system was expected to bring light rain later in the afternoon. At 3:17 p.m., multiple 911 calls reported a crash near Pier A Park in Hoboken, New Jersey. Witnesses said the helicopter appeared to stop midair before pieces broke off, consistent with preliminary emergency reports, Tisch said. Ipsitaa Banigrhi, a Jersey City resident, said the crash sounded ¡°like thunder,¡± she told WCBS. ¡°Then I saw black particles flying. Again, I thought maybe it¡¯s just dust or birds, and then we heard all the emergency vehicles and sirens go by. I think that¡¯s when it was like, ¡®OK, what¡¯s happening,¡¯¡± Banigrhi told WCBS. With the helicopter¡¯s catastrophic failure in midair, there was no way to guide the aircraft to safety, a former combat pilot told CNN¡¯s Kate Bolduan. ¡°There¡¯s nothing that pilot could have done in that situation to recover the aircraft,¡± Brandt Anderson said. First responders from NYPD and New York City Fire Department teams pulled six people from the water. Four victims were pronounced dead at the scene, and two others succumbed to injuries shortly after, Tisch said. Two children were taken to Jersey City Medical Center, where they were later pronounced dead, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said on X. The aircraft¡¯s main fuselage was retrieved from the river on Thursday evening, and dive operations continued Friday, according to the NTSB. The search continues for the main rotor, transmission, roof and tail of the aircraft. The company operating the helicopter was previously involved in two safety incidents investigated by federal aviation authorities. In 2015, a pilot for the New York Helicopter Charter company was forced to land in New Jersey after hovering 20 feet in the air for a short time. An initial inspection showed there ¡°may have been corrosion removed¡± from sections of the helicopter and that some of the helicopter¡¯s component parts may have been deformed to an extent to be ¡°considered unairworthy,¡± according to an FAA inspector at the time. The same helicopter was previously involved in a crash in Chile in 2010. In 2013, a pilot for the company was forced to land a helicopter carrying four passengers on the water near Manhattan after hearing a ¡°bang¡± that was followed by the ¡°Engine Out warning horn.¡± The pilot inflated the helicopter¡¯s floats and got the passengers to safety on a boat. ¡°The only thing I can tell you is that we are devastated,¡± Michael Roth, the CEO of the company operating the flight, told CNN of Thursday¡¯s crash. ¡°I¡¯m a father, a grandfather and my wife hasn¡¯t stopped crying since this afternoon.¡± When asked about the helicopter¡¯s maintenance, he said, ¡°That¡¯s something my director of maintenance handles.¡± The director of maintenance declined to comment. Maintenance records are not publicly accessible, and the NTSB restricts what companies can disclose during an ongoing investigation. ¡°(The pilot) called in that he was landing and that he needed fuel, and it should have taken him about three minutes to arrive, but 20 minutes later, he didn¡¯t arrive,¡± Roth told The Telegraph Thursday. Concern about the safety of low-altitude helicopter flights in the New York City area has a long history. ¡°Helicopter operations in the Hudson River have been under criticism for many, many years,¡± former Department of Transportation inspector general Mary Schiavo told CNN. At least 32 people died in helicopter accidents in New York City from 1977 to 2019, according to the Associated Press. That included a 2018 crash that killed five passengers in a ¡°doors-off¡± aerial tour, which subsequently became more tightly regulated by the FAA. The victims in that case drowned after being unable to free themselves from their safety harnesses after plunging into the water, an NTSB investigation found. ¡°I am calling for a serious reevaluation of current policies and am urging the city to consider an immediate moratorium on non-essential helicopter flights from city-owned heliports while investigations are ongoing,¡± New York City Councilwoman Amanda Far¨ªas, chair of the council¡¯s Committee on Economic Development, said Friday.

2025-04-13 04:15:55,320 - Try_train - INFO - Found 10 articles for: A sightseeing helicopter plunged into the Hudson River on Thursday, turning a family outing above Manhattan¡¯s misty skyline into a tragedy. The helicopter carried six people, including three children and their parents ¨C who have both worked for Siemens, a German multinational technology conglomerate. It lifted off from a Manhattan heliport and followed a familiar route: circling the Statue of Liberty, gliding north along the Hudson toward the George Washington Bridge and then turning south. About 16 minutes after takeoff, the aircraft crashed into the water, according to analysis by CNN and FlightRadar24. Witnesses described the helicopter flipping and spiraling before crashing near the New Jersey shoreline upside down, scattering debris across the river. ¡°The helicopter was a little bit like nose down, slightly, and I saw the propeller separating from the helicopter. It kept spinning in the air alone. Nothing was attached to it,¡± Sarah Jane Raymond Ryer, who saw the crash unfold, told CNN affiliate WCBS. A video obtained by CNN shows the rotor blades detached from the helicopter and flying through the air. ¡°The videotape in this case is very dramatic and very important to the investigation,¡± former National Transportation Safety Board managing director Peter Goelz told CNN on Friday. Eyewitness Avi Rakesh told CNN¡¯s Jessica Dean that what was left of the helicopter appeared to be so out of control, he didn¡¯t feel safe in his own building. ¡°Debris was flying everywhere. I was concerned that something might come and hit the window,¡± Rakesh said. Here¡¯s what we know about the crash that killed everyone on board: The victims include Agust¨ªn Escobar, 49, his wife, Merc¨¨ Camprub¨ª Montal, and their three children - two sons, ages 4 and 11, along with a daughter who was to turn 9 on Friday. New York City Mayor Eric Adams said the family was visiting from Spain, and Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said in a social media post that the family was in New York to celebrate Camprub¨ª¡¯s 40th birthday. ¡°I want to (say) that they left together,¡± Joan Camprub¨ª, whose sister was killed in the crash, said at a news conference on Saturday. ¡°They left without suffering, and they left with a smile on their faces. And that¡¯s important for us as a family. We want to remind and honor their happiness and their smiles forever.¡± ¡°We want to move the bodies as soon as possible, home, back home ¡­ with all the family to rest in peace together in our place,¡± Camprub¨ª added. Escobar served as CEO of Rail Infrastructure at Siemens Mobility, the transportation solutions division of Siemens AG. ¡°We are deeply saddened by the tragic helicopter crash in which Agustin Escobar and his family lost their lives. Our heartfelt condolences go out to all their loved ones,¡± a Siemens Mobility spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. Spain¡¯s Prime Minister, Pedro S¨¢nchez, expressed his condolences, calling the incident ¡°an unimaginable tragedy.¡± Merc¨¨ Camprub¨ª Montal was the global commercialization manager for Siemens Energy, according to her LinkedIn page. Siemens Energy is an independent company that was spun off from Siemens AG in 2020. ¡°We are deeply saddened and shocked by the loss of a colleague due to a tragic accident during vacation,¡± said a statement from Siemens Energy. ¡°Our thoughts and heartfelt condolences go out to the family, friends and colleagues of the victims.¡± In addition to her international corporate career, Camprub¨ª is known in Spain as a member of a prominent sports family. Camprub¨ª¡¯s grandfather and great-grandfather both served as presidents of FC Barcelona, one of the most popular soccer clubs in the world. The pilot was identified as 36-year-old Seankese Johnson, according to city officials. He was certified to fly commercial helicopters since August 2023, according to FAA records, and the NTSB noted he had completed 788 hours in the air. A friend of Johnson, helicopter pilot Matt Klier, told CNN affiliate WABC he was ¡°an amazing pilot.¡± ¡°He was just a super good dude,¡± Klier said, holding back tears. ¡°I¡¯m a helicopter pilot, we started at the same time. The man was an amazing pilot.¡± Mayor Adams spoke about Johnson at the news conference on Saturday after dropping off flowers in the water in honor of those who were killed. ¡°He was a Navy SEAL,¡± Adams said. ¡°He fought to defend this country, and we want to acknowledge him and his wife, Kathryn, for her loss, and our prayers are with all of the family members involved, and no words can fill the void, the loss.¡± ¡°Their sorrow is our sorrow,¡± Adams said. ¡°New York City is a family, and we consider this (as) a loss of our family members with unexpected pain and suffering.¡± The cause of the crash remains unclear, but its sudden descent stunned witnesses as first responders raced to rescue the victims. The helicopter took off at 2:59 p.m. from Manhattan¡¯s downtown heliport following a popular sightseeing route, New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. After circling the Statue of Liberty, it flew north along the Hudson River, reaching the George Washington Bridge by 3:08 p.m. It then turned south along the New Jersey shoreline, where it lost control shortly after, Tisch said.

A Siemens exec, his family and their pilot are dead after helicopter crashes into the Hudson River Visibility at the time was 10 miles, though the region was cloudy with winds of 10 to 15 mph and gusts up to 25 mph. A weather system was expected to bring light rain later in the afternoon. At 3:17 p.m., multiple 911 calls reported a crash near Pier A Park in Hoboken, New Jersey. Witnesses said the helicopter appeared to stop midair before pieces broke off, consistent with preliminary emergency reports, Tisch said. Ipsitaa Banigrhi, a Jersey City resident, said the crash sounded ¡°like thunder,¡± she told WCBS. ¡°Then I saw black particles flying. Again, I thought maybe it¡¯s just dust or birds, and then we heard all the emergency vehicles and sirens go by. I think that¡¯s when it was like, ¡®OK, what¡¯s happening,¡¯¡± Banigrhi told WCBS. With the helicopter¡¯s catastrophic failure in midair, there was no way to guide the aircraft to safety, a former combat pilot told CNN¡¯s Kate Bolduan. ¡°There¡¯s nothing that pilot could have done in that situation to recover the aircraft,¡± Brandt Anderson said. First responders from NYPD and New York City Fire Department teams pulled six people from the water. Four victims were pronounced dead at the scene, and two others succumbed to injuries shortly after, Tisch said. Two children were taken to Jersey City Medical Center, where they were later pronounced dead, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said on X. The aircraft¡¯s main fuselage was retrieved from the river on Thursday evening, and dive operations continued Friday, according to the NTSB. The search continues for the main rotor, transmission, roof and tail of the aircraft. The company operating the helicopter was previously involved in two safety incidents investigated by federal aviation authorities. In 2015, a pilot for the New York Helicopter Charter company was forced to land in New Jersey after hovering 20 feet in the air for a short time. An initial inspection showed there ¡°may have been corrosion removed¡± from sections of the helicopter and that some of the helicopter¡¯s component parts may have been deformed to an extent to be ¡°considered unairworthy,¡± according to an FAA inspector at the time. The same helicopter was previously involved in a crash in Chile in 2010. In 2013, a pilot for the company was forced to land a helicopter carrying four passengers on the water near Manhattan after hearing a ¡°bang¡± that was followed by the ¡°Engine Out warning horn.¡± The pilot inflated the helicopter¡¯s floats and got the passengers to safety on a boat. ¡°The only thing I can tell you is that we are devastated,¡± Michael Roth, the CEO of the company operating the flight, told CNN of Thursday¡¯s crash. ¡°I¡¯m a father, a grandfather and my wife hasn¡¯t stopped crying since this afternoon.¡± When asked about the helicopter¡¯s maintenance, he said, ¡°That¡¯s something my director of maintenance handles.¡± The director of maintenance declined to comment. Maintenance records are not publicly accessible, and the NTSB restricts what companies can disclose during an ongoing investigation. ¡°(The pilot) called in that he was landing and that he needed fuel, and it should have taken him about three minutes to arrive, but 20 minutes later, he didn¡¯t arrive,¡± Roth told The Telegraph Thursday. Concern about the safety of low-altitude helicopter flights in the New York City area has a long history. ¡°Helicopter operations in the Hudson River have been under criticism for many, many years,¡± former Department of Transportation inspector general Mary Schiavo told CNN. At least 32 people died in helicopter accidents in New York City from 1977 to 2019, according to the Associated Press. That included a 2018 crash that killed five passengers in a ¡°doors-off¡± aerial tour, which subsequently became more tightly regulated by the FAA. The victims in that case drowned after being unable to free themselves from their safety harnesses after plunging into the water, an NTSB investigation found. ¡°I am calling for a serious reevaluation of current policies and am urging the city to consider an immediate moratorium on non-essential helicopter flights from city-owned heliports while investigations are ongoing,¡± New York City Councilwoman Amanda Far¨ªas, chair of the council¡¯s Committee on Economic Development, said Friday.

Smartphones, computer monitors and various electronic parts are among the exempted products. The exemption applies to products entering the United States or removed from warehouses as early as April 5, according to the notice. The exemption, which comes after the Trump administration on Wednesday imposed a minimum tariff rate of 145% on Chinese goods imported to the United States, does not include the 20% tariff on Chinese goods for the country¡¯s role in the fentanyl trade. The tariff exemption would have a major impact on tech giants like Apple, which make iPhones and other products in China. Roughly 90% of Apple¡¯s iPhone production and assembly is based in China, according to Wedbush Securities¡¯ estimates. Analysts at Wedbush on Saturday called the tariff exclusion, ¡°the best news possible for tech investors.¡± ¡°Big Tech firms like Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft and the broader tech industry can breathe a huge sigh of relief this weekend into Monday,¡± Wedbush said in a statement. ¡°A big step forward for US tech to get these exemptions and the most bullish news we could have heard this weekend¡­now onto the next step in negotiations on the broader China tariff war which will take a number of months at least.¡± Nvidia and Microsoft declined to comment to CNN. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Counterpoint Research, a firm that monitors global smartphone shipments, estimated Apple has up to six weeks of inventory in the United States. Once that supply runs out, prices would have been expected to go up. The White House said on Saturday that Trump will continue to urge tech companies to move production to the United States. ¡°President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops. That¡¯s why the President has secured trillions of dollars in U.S. investments from the largest tech companies in the world, including Apple, (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), and Nvidia. At the direction of the President, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible,¡± White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. Trump had told reporters Friday on Air Force One that there could be possible exclusions to his sweeping tariffs. ¡°There could be a couple of exceptions for obvious reasons, but I would say 10% is a floor,¡± Trump said. Economists have warned the cost of tariffs may ultimately be passed on to the consumer. That fear has sent many Americans rushing to buy big-ticket items, such as cars and electronics, as consumer sentiment has dropped to record lows. Nintendo said on April 4 that it would postpone the US preorder date of its Switch 2 gaming console to ¡°assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions.¡± Initially priced at $450, the Switch 2 could instead cost around $600 as a result of tariffs, according to experts. The Trump administration says these tariffs would bring more manufacturing jobs to the United States and reverse a decades-long decline. But some products can¡¯t be easily made or found in the United States, thus increasing the costs to produce them in American factories. Semiconductors and microchips are among the products heavily outsourced to factories in Asia due to lower costs. Those electronic parts are now exempt, according to the Friday notice. That could help Asian chipmakers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), South Korea¡¯s Samsung and SK Hynix. ¡°The president has stated that autos, steel, pharmaceuticals, chips and other specific materials will be included in specific tariffs to ensure tariffs are applied fairly and effectively,¡± a White House official said.

2025-04-13 04:27:42,358 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: If paying $1,000 for a new iPhone already sounded expensive, consumers should brace for even greater sticker shock later this year. President Donald Trump¡¯s tariffs on foreign goods ¨C specifically those sourced from China ¨C are expected to heighten the prices of everyday tech products, from iPhones to laptops, cars and even smaller gadgets like headphones and computer mice. And iPhone prices could rise substantially and soon ¨C possibly in a matter of weeks or months, according to analysts who spoke with CNN. Like many tech companies, Apple¡¯s supply chain is largely based in China, which now faces a tariff of at least 145%, the White House clarified Thursday, meaning products and materials from the country are bound to get more expensive. In yet another escalation in the ongoing trade war with Beijing, Trump announced on Wednesday a 90-day pause in reciprocal tariffs on every country except China. Related article
iPhone could triple in price to $3,500 if they¡¯re made in the US In the near term, Apple and its many partners will have to carefully manage the iPhone inventory currently stored in the US. But if the Trump administration¡¯s tariffs stick, Apple might have to make long-term adjustments to the way it sources, builds and potentially even releases new products. Apple received an exemption from tariffs on certain products during Trump¡¯s previous administration, but there hasn¡¯t been any indication of whether it will be granted similar immunity this time. ¡°I think (Apple) will have to go through a period of pain,¡± said Jack Leathem, an analyst at market research firm Canalys that covers the smartphone industry. ¡°And that will mean¡­ price rises.¡± Apple declined to comment. With 90% of Apple¡¯s iPhone production and assembly based in China, according to Wedbush Securities¡¯ estimates, iPhone prices are likely to rise if Trump¡¯s tariffs remain in place. When and by how much are still up in the air. The timing largely depends on Apple¡¯s US iPhone inventory, which hinges on consumers demand ahead of anticipated tariff price hikes. While Apple isn¡¯t expected to release its next new iPhone until September, it¡¯s possible prices could rise sooner if Apple runs through its current stock in the US. ¡°The reality is, the price¡­ increases that we¡¯re going to see will hit all phones from Apple, as well as others, when inventory runs out,¡± said Ryan Reith, group vice president for the International Data Corporation¡¯s (IDC) Worldwide Device Tracker. Reith estimates that Apple has about three weeks of inventory in the US that it can ¡°maximize,¡± while Canalys believes there is likely enough iPhone inventory for the next two to three months. Counterpoint Research, another firm that monitors global smartphone shipments, estimates Apple likely has 4.5 to six weeks of inventory in the US, although February data indicates ¡°a spike to well above those levels,¡± Gerrit Schneemann, a senior analyst for Counterpoint, said via email. Although it¡¯s too soon to tell exactly how the news of Trump¡¯s tariffs is impacting US smartphone shipments, Leathem said Canalys has seen ¡°some of the largest numbers of shipments of devices into the market¡± in recent weeks. Pricing, however, will depend on whether Apple and its partners decide to absorb some of the additional cost. Analysts at UBS estimate that the base model of a $1,199 iPhone 16 Pro Max assembled in mainland China could increase by $800, or 67%, while an iPhone 16 Pro assembled in India could see just a $45 increase. Those estimates factor in Trump¡¯s newly announced 125% tariff on Chinese imports and 90-day pause on all other ¡°reciprocal¡± tariffs. Before Wednesday¡¯s news, the firm had put those price increases at $675 and $120, respectively. Wireless carriers could also offer discounts on previous generation phones to push customers towards older devices that are already in low inventory, says Reith. Service providers also typically offer monthly installment payment plans for new phones, which could help relieve some of the cost passed down to consumers. Data from analytics firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners indicates that 55% of phone buyers in the US ¨C including those who purchase flip phones and basic mobile phones ¨C purchase their device through installment plans like these. Trump believes iPhone production could move to the US, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday. But the possibility of that seems unlikely. Over the past several years, Apple has shifted parts of its supply chain to India and Vietnam to reduce reliance on China. Apple has reportedly been sourcing more of its US-bound iPhones from India instead of China in recent days, according to reports from The Financial Times and The Times of India. Even if it shifted production to the US, Apple would likely still source many of its components from Asian countries, as Bank of America analysts wrote in a research note on April 3. ¡°Everything that¡¯s inside, that still really comes through China,¡± said Reith. ¡°And that¡¯s not going to change anytime soon.¡± Building an iPhone in the US would also be more expensive, partially because of higher labor costs, said Willy Shih, a professor of management practice in business administration at Harvard Business School. Bank of America¡¯s research said it would cost roughly 20% more to make an iPhone in the US, while Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said a US-made iPhone could be as pricey as $3,500. Apple announced in February that it plans to invest $500 billion in expanding its US footprint. But iPhone factories aren¡¯t part of that commitment; it instead includes new server production facilities to power its Apple Intelligence software features and a Detroit academy to train small businesses on manufacturing techniques, among other plans. And building new facilities could take years, whereas it¡¯s unclear how long Trump¡¯s tariffs will remain in place. But a bigger problem than simply building a new factory may be finding Americans who would want to work in it. ¡°I think they would be hard-pressed to get the scale of labor,¡± said Shih. ¡°They¡¯d be hard-pressed to find people who are willing to do that type of job.¡± Then there¡¯s the question of whether Apple could make broader changes to its product launch schedule if the US ¨C part of the company¡¯s largest market ¨C becomes increasingly challenging because of tariffs. Doing so could be a potential strategy to mitigate the tariffs¡¯ impact, along with supply chain changes and price increases, Bank of America noted in its April 3 report. Apple hasn¡¯t mentioned any changes to its product lineup or strategy in response to the tariffs. But Reith said he could see the company adjusting its product launch schedule temporarily, then shifting back to a more regular product launch cycle if tariffs persist ¨C although this is his opinion, and he hasn¡¯t heard of any plans to do so. In the early days of the pandemic in 2020, for example, Apple announced its new iPhones in October instead of September. ¡°Everything is on the table,¡± Reith said.

And iPhone prices could rise substantially and soon ¨C possibly in a matter of weeks or months, according to analysts who spoke with CNN. Like many tech companies, Apple¡¯s supply chain is largely based in China, which now faces a tariff of at least 145%, the White House clarified Thursday, meaning products and materials from the country are bound to get more expensive. In yet another escalation in the ongoing trade war with Beijing, Trump announced on Wednesday a 90-day pause in reciprocal tariffs on every country except China. Related article
iPhone could triple in price to $3,500 if they¡¯re made in the US In the near term, Apple and its many partners will have to carefully manage the iPhone inventory currently stored in the US. But if the Trump administration¡¯s tariffs stick, Apple might have to make long-term adjustments to the way it sources, builds and potentially even releases new products. Apple received an exemption from tariffs on certain products during Trump¡¯s previous administration, but there hasn¡¯t been any indication of whether it will be granted similar immunity this time. ¡°I think (Apple) will have to go through a period of pain,¡± said Jack Leathem, an analyst at market research firm Canalys that covers the smartphone industry. ¡°And that will mean¡­ price rises.¡± Apple declined to comment. With 90% of Apple¡¯s iPhone production and assembly based in China, according to Wedbush Securities¡¯ estimates, iPhone prices are likely to rise if Trump¡¯s tariffs remain in place. When and by how much are still up in the air. The timing largely depends on Apple¡¯s US iPhone inventory, which hinges on consumers demand ahead of anticipated tariff price hikes. While Apple isn¡¯t expected to release its next new iPhone until September, it¡¯s possible prices could rise sooner if Apple runs through its current stock in the US. ¡°The reality is, the price¡­ increases that we¡¯re going to see will hit all phones from Apple, as well as others, when inventory runs out,¡± said Ryan Reith, group vice president for the International Data Corporation¡¯s (IDC) Worldwide Device Tracker. Reith estimates that Apple has about three weeks of inventory in the US that it can ¡°maximize,¡± while Canalys believes there is likely enough iPhone inventory for the next two to three months. Counterpoint Research, another firm that monitors global smartphone shipments, estimates Apple likely has 4.5 to six weeks of inventory in the US, although February data indicates ¡°a spike to well above those levels,¡± Gerrit Schneemann, a senior analyst for Counterpoint, said via email. Although it¡¯s too soon to tell exactly how the news of Trump¡¯s tariffs is impacting US smartphone shipments, Leathem said Canalys has seen ¡°some of the largest numbers of shipments of devices into the market¡± in recent weeks. Pricing, however, will depend on whether Apple and its partners decide to absorb some of the additional cost. Analysts at UBS estimate that the base model of a $1,199 iPhone 16 Pro Max assembled in mainland China could increase by $800, or 67%, while an iPhone 16 Pro assembled in India could see just a $45 increase. Those estimates factor in Trump¡¯s newly announced 125% tariff on Chinese imports and 90-day pause on all other ¡°reciprocal¡± tariffs. Before Wednesday¡¯s news, the firm had put those price increases at $675 and $120, respectively. Wireless carriers could also offer discounts on previous generation phones to push customers towards older devices that are already in low inventory, says Reith. Service providers also typically offer monthly installment payment plans for new phones, which could help relieve some of the cost passed down to consumers. Data from analytics firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners indicates that 55% of phone buyers in the US ¨C including those who purchase flip phones and basic mobile phones ¨C purchase their device through installment plans like these. Trump believes iPhone production could move to the US, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday. But the possibility of that seems unlikely. Over the past several years, Apple has shifted parts of its supply chain to India and Vietnam to reduce reliance on China. Apple has reportedly been sourcing more of its US-bound iPhones from India instead of China in recent days, according to reports from The Financial Times and The Times of India. Even if it shifted production to the US, Apple would likely still source many of its components from Asian countries, as Bank of America analysts wrote in a research note on April 3. ¡°Everything that¡¯s inside, that still really comes through China,¡± said Reith. ¡°And that¡¯s not going to change anytime soon.¡± Building an iPhone in the US would also be more expensive, partially because of higher labor costs, said Willy Shih, a professor of management practice in business administration at Harvard Business School. Bank of America¡¯s research said it would cost roughly 20% more to make an iPhone in the US, while Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said a US-made iPhone could be as pricey as $3,500. Apple announced in February that it plans to invest $500 billion in expanding its US footprint. But iPhone factories aren¡¯t part of that commitment; it instead includes new server production facilities to power its Apple Intelligence software features and a Detroit academy to train small businesses on manufacturing techniques, among other plans. And building new facilities could take years, whereas it¡¯s unclear how long Trump¡¯s tariffs will remain in place. But a bigger problem than simply building a new factory may be finding Americans who would want to work in it. ¡°I think they would be hard-pressed to get the scale of labor,¡± said Shih. ¡°They¡¯d be hard-pressed to find people who are willing to do that type of job.¡± Then there¡¯s the question of whether Apple could make broader changes to its product launch schedule if the US ¨C part of the company¡¯s largest market ¨C becomes increasingly challenging because of tariffs. Doing so could be a potential strategy to mitigate the tariffs¡¯ impact, along with supply chain changes and price increases, Bank of America noted in its April 3 report. Apple hasn¡¯t mentioned any changes to its product lineup or strategy in response to the tariffs. But Reith said he could see the company adjusting its product launch schedule temporarily, then shifting back to a more regular product launch cycle if tariffs persist ¨C although this is his opinion, and he hasn¡¯t heard of any plans to do so. In the early days of the pandemic in 2020, for example, Apple announced its new iPhones in October instead of September. ¡°Everything is on the table,¡± Reith said. This story has been updated with additional information and context.

2025-04-13 15:39:05,074 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: If paying $1,000 for a new iPhone already sounded expensive, consumers should brace for even greater sticker shock later this year. President Donald Trump¡¯s tariffs on foreign goods ¨C specifically those sourced from China ¨C are expected to heighten the prices of everyday tech products, from iPhones to laptops, cars and even smaller gadgets like headphones and computer mice. And iPhone prices could rise substantially and soon ¨C possibly in a matter of weeks or months, according to analysts who spoke with CNN. Like many tech companies, Apple¡¯s supply chain is largely based in China, which now faces a tariff of at least 145%, the White House clarified Thursday, meaning products and materials from the country are bound to get more expensive. In yet another escalation in the ongoing trade war with Beijing, Trump announced on Wednesday a 90-day pause in reciprocal tariffs on every country except China. Related article
iPhone could triple in price to $3,500 if they¡¯re made in the US In the near term, Apple and its many partners will have to carefully manage the iPhone inventory currently stored in the US. But if the Trump administration¡¯s tariffs stick, Apple might have to make long-term adjustments to the way it sources, builds and potentially even releases new products. Apple received an exemption from tariffs on certain products during Trump¡¯s previous administration, but there hasn¡¯t been any indication of whether it will be granted similar immunity this time. ¡°I think (Apple) will have to go through a period of pain,¡± said Jack Leathem, an analyst at market research firm Canalys that covers the smartphone industry. ¡°And that will mean¡­ price rises.¡± Apple declined to comment. With 90% of Apple¡¯s iPhone production and assembly based in China, according to Wedbush Securities¡¯ estimates, iPhone prices are likely to rise if Trump¡¯s tariffs remain in place. When and by how much are still up in the air. The timing largely depends on Apple¡¯s US iPhone inventory, which hinges on consumers demand ahead of anticipated tariff price hikes. While Apple isn¡¯t expected to release its next new iPhone until September, it¡¯s possible prices could rise sooner if Apple runs through its current stock in the US. ¡°The reality is, the price¡­ increases that we¡¯re going to see will hit all phones from Apple, as well as others, when inventory runs out,¡± said Ryan Reith, group vice president for the International Data Corporation¡¯s (IDC) Worldwide Device Tracker. Reith estimates that Apple has about three weeks of inventory in the US that it can ¡°maximize,¡± while Canalys believes there is likely enough iPhone inventory for the next two to three months. Counterpoint Research, another firm that monitors global smartphone shipments, estimates Apple likely has 4.5 to six weeks of inventory in the US, although February data indicates ¡°a spike to well above those levels,¡± Gerrit Schneemann, a senior analyst for Counterpoint, said via email. Although it¡¯s too soon to tell exactly how the news of Trump¡¯s tariffs is impacting US smartphone shipments, Leathem said Canalys has seen ¡°some of the largest numbers of shipments of devices into the market¡± in recent weeks. Pricing, however, will depend on whether Apple and its partners decide to absorb some of the additional cost. Analysts at UBS estimate that the base model of a $1,199 iPhone 16 Pro Max assembled in mainland China could increase by $800, or 67%, while an iPhone 16 Pro assembled in India could see just a $45 increase. Those estimates factor in Trump¡¯s newly announced 125% tariff on Chinese imports and 90-day pause on all other ¡°reciprocal¡± tariffs. Before Wednesday¡¯s news, the firm had put those price increases at $675 and $120, respectively. Wireless carriers could also offer discounts on previous generation phones to push customers towards older devices that are already in low inventory, says Reith. Service providers also typically offer monthly installment payment plans for new phones, which could help relieve some of the cost passed down to consumers. Data from analytics firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners indicates that 55% of phone buyers in the US ¨C including those who purchase flip phones and basic mobile phones ¨C purchase their device through installment plans like these. Trump believes iPhone production could move to the US, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday. But the possibility of that seems unlikely. Over the past several years, Apple has shifted parts of its supply chain to India and Vietnam to reduce reliance on China. Apple has reportedly been sourcing more of its US-bound iPhones from India instead of China in recent days, according to reports from The Financial Times and The Times of India. Even if it shifted production to the US, Apple would likely still source many of its components from Asian countries, as Bank of America analysts wrote in a research note on April 3. ¡°Everything that¡¯s inside, that still really comes through China,¡± said Reith. ¡°And that¡¯s not going to change anytime soon.¡± Building an iPhone in the US would also be more expensive, partially because of higher labor costs, said Willy Shih, a professor of management practice in business administration at Harvard Business School. Bank of America¡¯s research said it would cost roughly 20% more to make an iPhone in the US, while Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said a US-made iPhone could be as pricey as $3,500. Apple announced in February that it plans to invest $500 billion in expanding its US footprint. But iPhone factories aren¡¯t part of that commitment; it instead includes new server production facilities to power its Apple Intelligence software features and a Detroit academy to train small businesses on manufacturing techniques, among other plans. And building new facilities could take years, whereas it¡¯s unclear how long Trump¡¯s tariffs will remain in place. But a bigger problem than simply building a new factory may be finding Americans who would want to work in it. ¡°I think they would be hard-pressed to get the scale of labor,¡± said Shih. ¡°They¡¯d be hard-pressed to find people who are willing to do that type of job.¡± Then there¡¯s the question of whether Apple could make broader changes to its product launch schedule if the US ¨C part of the company¡¯s largest market ¨C becomes increasingly challenging because of tariffs. Doing so could be a potential strategy to mitigate the tariffs¡¯ impact, along with supply chain changes and price increases, Bank of America noted in its April 3 report. Apple hasn¡¯t mentioned any changes to its product lineup or strategy in response to the tariffs. But Reith said he could see the company adjusting its product launch schedule temporarily, then shifting back to a more regular product launch cycle if tariffs persist ¨C although this is his opinion, and he hasn¡¯t heard of any plans to do so. In the early days of the pandemic in 2020, for example, Apple announced its new iPhones in October instead of September. ¡°Everything is on the table,¡± Reith said. This story has been updated with additional information and context.

2025-04-13 16:06:08,512 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: Straining every fiber to stay atop the 1,000 pound camel churning up sand two meters beneath her as it gallops at over 40 kilometers (24 miles) an hour, Taylor Dees is a long way from Texas. It¡¯s around 12,700 kilometers (7,890 miles) from her hometown of Moulton to the Saudi Arabian city of Taif, and it takes just two more for her to clinch victory at the Crown Prince Camel Festival¡¯s first ever all-women race. That was back in August 2023, just one year on from her mounting a camel for the first time. It turns out that Dees ¡ª who rode horses frequently as a child ¡ª is as fast a learner as she is a rider. ¡°It really starts with an awareness of animals and awareness of your own body,¡± she told CNN. ¡°Once you get into the rhythm and you understand how the animal is moving and how you can move with the animal, it¡¯s quite easy.¡± Dees moved to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in 2017, after falling in love with the country on vacation. Now living in the capital of Abu Dhabi, the dietician balances her roles as a business owner and mother with that of being a trailblazing figure in her sport. The racing of dromedaries, a single-humped species also known as the Arabian camel, is a centuries-old passion in the region and endures in both popularity and lucrativeness, with prize money reaching multi-million-dollar figures. However, it¡¯s a storied history that has been predominantly written by men ¡ª until recently. Dees is one of the many success stories to emerge from the UAE¡¯s Arabian Desert Camel Riding Center (ADCRC), co-founded by German expat Linda Krockenberger. Krockenberger, who moved to the UAE in 2015, tried for years to find a place to ride, but was frequently turned down on account of her gender. In a 2022 interview she told CNN she recalled once being told ¡°It will be good if you can dress like a boy.¡± Krockenberger opened the school in 2021, and she says it received the first ever license for a camel riding center in the country. The ADCRC launched the UAE¡¯s maiden all-women camel racing team ¡ª a development that immediately piqued Dees¡¯ interest. ¡°I think so many times, particularly around animals, women are seen as too fragile or too feminine to be able to be in that environment,¡± said Dees. ¡°Yes, we can be more fragile and feminine, but we can also be very strong and very brave and be very physically fit in order to ride camels.¡± Dees, has raced in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia ¡ª including in the ancient city of AlUla ¡ª but will be taking a season off from competing with the ADCRC. Though there are typically one to two months between events, Dees has a rigorous weekly training regime that focuses heavily on endurance. Trots gradually progress to short and then long runs as a way of building stamina and ensuring both camel and rider arrive on race day at peak fitness. ¡°The outcome of the race is so reliant on the fitness and quality of the camel,¡± Dees explained. ¡°Yes, your riding style, form, and ability plays a part but even the best rider will not win on a camel that is less fit than the camel next to it.¡± Upon her return next season, Dees will saddle up against other talents that have emerged from the ADCRC, including Krockenberger, Jordan¡¯s Rawan Salah, and French-native Coralie Viroulaud, victor of last season¡¯s all-women C1 Championship. Yet Dees does not see the trio as rivals. She welcomes the competition, paradoxically because competition is not her primary motivation. ¡°I don¡¯t race to win,¡± Dees explained. ¡°I do it because, first and foremost, it¡¯s fun. Second, I want people to see that as women, we are strong, we are confident, and we can do things that maybe men perceive we cannot. ¡°Each international race is a bit bigger, which I love because it means that there are more women who are willing to step out of their comfort zone and who are willing to step out of this very male-dominated sport and prove that yes ¡ª women can not only do it, but we can do it very well, we can do it very safely and we can be successful in it as well.¡±

Her agency, Elite Model Management, announced her death via social media on Thursday, saying she had been battling a rare brain condition. A message confirming her death was also posted to Markovic¡¯s official Instagram stories, just hours after a post announced she was ¡°battling for her life.¡± Elite Model Management¡¯s statement went on to call Markovic ¡°a bright shining light,¡± adding: ¡°Modeling was one of Lucy¡¯s dreams, and we are deeply honored to have been part of that journey with her,¡± it continued. ¡°She brought elegance, strength, and beauty to her work. But more than that, she brought herself ¡ª her warmth, her laughter, her light.¡± Markovic was a teenager when she competed on the ninth season of ¡°Australia¡¯s Next Top Model,¡± a show based on Tyra Banks¡¯ ¡°America¡¯s Next Top Model,¡± in 2015. She finished runner up, losing out in the final to Brittany Beattie. She went on to forge a successful modeling career, appearing in campaigns for brands like Versace and Victoria Beckham, and walking catwalks for Oscar de la Renta, Bulgari, Givenchy and Dolce & Gabbana, among others. She also appeared in high-profile magazines including Marie Claire and various international editions of Vogue. Three weeks ago, Markovic announced on Instagram she would be undergoing surgery for a brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM), a tangle of blood vessels that can lead to brain damage and stroke. She described the malformation as ¡°the size of a golf ball¡± and said she had experienced seizures. The post revealed she had battled the condition for four years.

2025-04-13 16:47:00,684 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: Workers have been told to hurry home, classes have been suspended and outdoor events have been cancelled as northern China braces for extreme winds this weekend. Millions have been urged to stay indoors, with some state media outlets warning that people weighing less than 50kg (110lbs - about eight stone) may be "easily blown away". Winds reaching 150kph (93mph) are expected to sweep Beijing, Tianjin and other parts of Hebei region from Friday to Sunday, as a cold vortex moves southeast from Mongolia. For the first time in a decade, Beijing has issued an orange alert for gales - the second-highest in a four-tier weather warning system. Strong winds sweeping from Mongolia are not uncommon, especially at this time of the year. But the impending winds are expected to be stronger than anything the area has seen in years. Temperatures in Beijing are expected to drop by 13C within 24 hours, when the strongest winds hit on Saturday, authorities said. "This strong wind is extreme, lasts for a long time, affects a wide area, and is highly disastrous," the Beijing Meteorological Service said. China measures wind speed with a scale that goes from level 1 to 17. A level 11 wind, according to the China Meteorological Administration, can cause "serious damage", while a level 12 wind brings "extreme destruction". The winds this weekend are expected to range from level 11 to 13. Several sporting events slated for the weekend have been suspended, including the world's first humanoid robot half marathon, which will now be held on 19 April. Parks and tourist attractions have been closed as authorities have told residents to avoid outdoor activities, while construction works and train services have been suspended. Thousands of trees across the city have been reinforced or pruned to prevent them from falling. Officials have warned people to avoid entering mountains and forests, where gusts are expected to be especially strong. As residents hunker down, social media users are finding humour in their shelved weekend plans. "This wind is so sensible, it starts on Friday evening and ends on Sunday, without disrupting work on Monday at all," said a Weibo user. Hashtags about the strong winds, and the warning that those weighing less than 50kg could be swept away, have been trending on Chinese social media. One Weibo user quipped: "I eat so much all the time, just for this day." Beijing has also issued an alert for forest fires and prohibited people from starting fires outdoors. The winds are expected to start weakening on Sunday night.

Kennedy Jr. made several unsupported or misleading claims about the measles vaccine, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said is safe and ¡°the most important tool to prevent¡± the disease. Meanwhile, a measles outbreak in Texas continues to expand.
- Kennedy said that the ¡°vaccine wanes about 4.5% per year.¡± Although antibody levels can fall, there¡¯s no evidence that overall vaccine protection declines that quickly. It would mean thousands of vaccinated people should have contracted measles in the latest outbreak.
- The health secretary made the unsupported claim that the measles vaccine leads to ¡°deaths every year¡± and misleadingly said it causes ¡°all the illnesses¡± of the disease. The vaccine can cause some similar symptoms but is much safer than getting measles.
- Kennedy misleadingly said the measles vaccine ¡°does not appear to provide maternal immunity.¡± Evidence suggests that vaccinated mothers pass fewer protective antibodies on to their babies than previously infected moms, but in both cases this protection wanes before the infant¡¯s first year. The best way to ensure babies don¡¯t contract measles is to vaccinate everyone around them.
The measles vaccine, which is part of the measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccine, is highly effective, according to the CDC. Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles, likely for life ¡ª and even one dose is 93% effective. As with any medical product, the MMR vaccine is not 100% safe. But the vast majority of people experience no or only mild and temporary side effects, and getting the vaccine is much safer than getting measles. As we¡¯ve recently reported, measles is an extremely contagious viral disease, which can be deadly or cause long-term health issues.
During the interview, which was held at a fast-food restaurant chain and aired on March 11, Kennedy continued to downplay the seriousness of a measles outbreak that is expanding, although he did say the vaccine stops ¡°the spread of the disease¡± and said the government should ¡°encourage¡± but not ¡°force¡± vaccination. There are now more than 300 cases.
MMR Vaccine Waning
Minimizing the current outbreak, Kennedy emphasized that measles outbreaks happen every year ¡ª incorrectly adding that there are sometimes ¡°hundreds¡± of them ¡ª and he placed partial blame on the MMR vaccine.
¡°Part of that is that there are people who don¡¯t vaccinate, but also the vaccine itself wanes,¡± he said, of why there are outbreaks every year. ¡°The vaccine wanes about 4.5% per year. So that means older people are essentially unvaccinated. They aren¡¯t ¡ª their immune system is not protected.¡±
That¡¯s wrong. The measles vaccine offers strong and long-lasting protection against the virus. Although some studies show that the concentration of measles antibodies in vaccinated people decreases over time, overall vaccine immunity is not waning that quickly. If it were, far more vaccinated people would get measles.
Furthermore, older vaccinated people aren¡¯t the ones contracting measles. Most people 65 years and older had measles as children and also lived during a time when they would have had measles exposures afterward. This means their measles immunity is likely quite robust.
Outbreaks primarily occur because not enough people are vaccinated. Rarely, vaccinated people can develop infections, but they typically do not get as sick and are not driving spread of the disease. A 2024 systematic review found that only about 10% of vaccinated people who get infected because of waning immunity passed the virus on to anyone at all ¡ª a ¡°remarkably low¡± rate that cannot sustain an outbreak.
As of March 20, 95% of the measles infections so far this year are among people who are either unvaccinated or with an unknown vaccination status, according to the CDC. In Texas, where an outbreak began in January and is thought to have spread to neighboring states, out of the 309 cases identified, only two are vaccinated people, as of March 21. In New Mexico, only four of the 42 cases are in vaccinated people. There are four probable cases in Oklahoma, all of them in unvaccinated people. Most of the infections, according to CDC data, have been in people 19 years old or younger.
¡°In Texas and a growing number of states across the country, declining vaccination rates are fueling a staggering increase in measles illnesses, measles hospitalizations, and the first death from the disease in years¡ª all primarily among unvaccinated populations,¡± Dr. Bruce A. Scott, president of the American Medical Association, said in a statement on March 5. A day later, New Mexico reported that an unvaccinated adult who died also tested positive for measles.
It is not entirely clear what Kennedy meant when he said that ¡°the vaccine wanes¡± about 4.5% per year, or what his source is for such a statement. We reached out to HHS to ask for support for his claim, but we didn¡¯t hear back.
Dr. Michael Mina, an infectious disease expert who previously was a professor at Harvard School of Public Health, told us that if Kennedy was referring to clinical protection provided by the vaccine, that would be ¡°just wrong.¡±
¡°If we had 4.5% waning, then, you know, everyone who is an adult would be susceptible¡± to measles, he said, since at that rate it would take only about 22 years to reach zero protection ¡ª and there would be thousands of measles cases in vaccinated people in the latest outbreak alone. ¡°And that¡¯s just not what we see.¡± (The first of two doses is given at 12 to 15 months.)
A number of studies show that the concentration of measles antibodies does begin to drop as more time elapses after vaccination, including a study in Slovakia that reported an average annual decline in measles antibodies of 4.8% in people 10 to 33 years old after a second dose.
But it¡¯s not necessarily clear what antibody level is protective, and circulating antibodies aren¡¯t the only way the immune system protects against the disease.
There are long-lived antibody-producing cells in the bone marrow, Mina said, which serve as a kind of ¡°cushion of protection.¡± Although total antibody levels may decline over time, the smaller amount of antibodies produced by these cells can last decades, and may on its own provide sufficient protection. Calculations based on total antibody level declines, then, may overestimate when a person would become susceptible to measles infection due to antibody waning.
In addition, unlike the coronavirus, Mina said, the measles virus infects much more slowly, traveling through lymph nodes, which are full of immune cells. If the measles virus ¡°bumps up against even a few anti-measles¡± cells, he said, ¡°those cells will rapidly expand and defeat the virus.¡± As a result, measles immunity may still be very strong even in a person whose measles antibodies have fallen substantially.
Other studies, using modeling or case data that reflect what happens during outbreaks, have found that vaccine protection against measles does wane, but is much slower and less significant than Kennedy claimed.
A 2024 study in England, for example, used a mathematical model to reproduce the way that measles spread in England between 2010 and 2019, using scenarios that did or didn¡¯t include waning. Waning was needed to explain the number of cases in vaccinated people, but it was very slow ¡ª about 0.04% per year.
¡°So the protection remains around 99% 20 years after vaccination,¡± Alexis Robert, a mathematical modeler in infectious disease dynamics at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and the corresponding author of the study, told us in an email.
A 2023 study in France similarly concluded protection from the vaccine waned 0.22% per year, while a study in Germany found that ¡°only a small percentage (maximum 1%) of cases could be ascribed to waning immunity.¡±
Robert noted that the Slovak study¡¯s 4.8% per year of antibody waning could be misleading, as the authors also estimated that at around 30 years of age, only about 10% of people vaccinated with two doses of the vaccine would have antibody levels below the threshold of protection ¡ª ¡°a far better¡± level of protection than what the 4.8% number might suggest.
Indeed, Robert said that although there are differences in the various studies, ¡°all converge towards a very high and long-lasting immunity brought by measles vaccines,¡± especially after two doses. ¡°The vast majority of adults who received two doses of vaccine in their childhood will therefore have protection against measles infection,¡± he said.
Waning of vaccine protection may become a larger issue in the future. This is because as widespread vaccination has eliminated measles, people have not had as many subsequent exposures to the disease that can boost immunity.
In fact, although it is often stated that measles infection provides more durable immunity than vaccination ¡ª a claim Kennedy repeated to Hannity ¡ª Mina said it isn¡¯t clear that¡¯s necessarily true. It could be that the regular measles exposures that have occurred while measles continued to circulate is what makes natural immunity appear longer-lasting, not the infection itself.
Many people born in the 1980s and ¡®90s have only been vaccinated and have not been exposed to measles, since they grew up in an era with few measles infections. For this reason, it¡¯s possible that when today¡¯s 30- and 40-year-olds are 50 or so, their measles immunity will be low enough that it would be a good idea to recommend a measles booster, Mina said. But right now, there simply aren¡¯t ¡°big measles outbreaks happening amongst 40-year-olds who are vaccinated.¡±
No Evidence the MMR Vaccine Causes Deaths ¡®Every Year¡¯
In addition to being highly effective, the MMR vaccine is also very safe. According to the CDC, although mild side effects are expected with any vaccine, most people who receive an ¡°MMR vaccine do not have any serious problems with it.¡±

Their respective intentions to bid for the 2031 and 2035 editions are alone in the contests after a first deadline to enter the race passed. The first formal bid documents must be signed by the end of April. FIFA President Gianni Infantino told European soccer officials the governing body received one expression of interest to host the 2031 event ¡ª from the US with the possibility of other countries in the CONCACAF region joining the project. That long-promised bid would likely include Mexico. Related article
Netflix purchases US broadcasting rights for next two FIFA Women¡¯s World Cups ¡°We look forward to sharing more details and unveiling our full vision for the 2031 FIFA Women¡¯s World Cup in the near future,¡± the US Soccer Federation said in a statement. FIFA has just one ¡°valid bid¡± to host the 2035 event, from the British member federations centered on England, Infantino said at UEFA¡¯s annual meeting in Belgrade, Serbia. ¡°Hosting the first FIFA World Cup since 1966 with our home nations partners will be very special,¡± English FA CEO Mark Bullingham said. ¡°The hard work starts now, to put together the best possible bid by the end of the year.¡± The UK¡¯s interest was quickly supported last month by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer when FIFA said it was formally seeking bids from member federations. FIFA excluded Europe from the 2031 contest, clearing the way for a long-expected US win. Spanish soccer officials said last week they hoped to bid, possibly with Portugal and Morocco in a repeat of the co-hosting plan for the men¡¯s 2030 World Cup. It was unclear why Spain did not then meet Monday¡¯s deadline set by FIFA to express interest in bidding. Infantino¡¯s comments to the annual meeting of UEFA seemed to rule out a Spain bid now being allowed. ¡°So the path is there for the Women¡¯s World Cup to be taking place in ¡¯31 and ¡¯35 in some great countries,¡± the FIFA president said, ¡°to boost even more the women¡¯s football movement.¡± FIFA is scheduled to confirm Women¡¯s World Cup hosts next year. The 2027 edition with 32 teams is being hosted by Brazil. The Women¡¯s World Cup would return to the US for the first time since the 2003 edition. The US also hosted in 1999. England hosted the Women¡¯s European Championship in 2022 ¡ª which the home team won ¡ª and the men¡¯s Euro 2028 will be co-hosted by England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland. In a further boost for women¡¯s soccer, Infantino detailed FIFA¡¯s plan to have more women¡¯s teams than men¡¯s playing at the next Olympics. There were just 12 teams in the women¡¯s tournament at the 2024 Paris Olympics and 16 in the men¡¯s tournament. Though the International Olympic Committee strongly supports gender equality at the games, adding four more women¡¯s teams ¡ª and about 70 extra players, plus team officials ¡ª would push the limit of agreed athlete quotas for organizers in Los Angeles. Infantino said on Thursday that FIFA¡¯s new proposal is to flip the numbers to have 16 women¡¯s teams and 12 in the men¡¯s tournaments. The final decision is for the IOC, which has an executive board meeting next Wednesday.

Besix Group, a construction company overseeing the project in Al Khobar, confirmed in a statement to CNN Sports that ¡°a worker sadly lost their life¡± at the stadium site on March 12. ¡°We have been operating on this site for several months in close partnership with our joint venture partner Al Bawani, following detailed and validated safety procedures that have consistently proven effective,¡± the statement said.

Saudi Arabia officially announced as the 2034 World Cup host. Human rights groups warn of ¡®unimaginable human cost¡¯ ¡°The incident in question is currently under thorough investigation by the authorities, and we are fully cooperating to determine the exact circumstances. In the interest of the investigation, we will not provide further comments at this stage.¡± Besix went on to say that it has ¡°a long tradition of transparency¡± when it comes to ¡°guarantee(ing) and promot(ing) the rights of migrant workers.¡± CNN Sports has contacted Al Bawani, global soccer governing body FIFA and the 2034 World Cup organizing committee for further comment on the worker¡¯s death. The Aramco Stadium, located in the east of Saudi Arabia, is scheduled to be completed in 2026. The 47,000-seat venue is one of the 15 sites set to host World Cup matches, as well as staging Asian Cup games in 2027. Saudi Arabia was confirmed as the host of the 2034 World Cup in December, part of the nation¡¯s wider push to invest in sports and diversify the economy. It has meant heavy investment into infrastructure projects, which includes building or renovating the 15 host stadiums and creating 185,000 new hotel rooms. However, human rights groups have warned of the potentially significant toll attached to Saudi Arabia hosting the tournament. Many migrant workers still exist in the ¡°Kafala¡± sponsorship system, which ties people to a specific employer. Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a June statement that employees are ¡°vulnerable to widespread abuse, including contract substitution, exorbitant recruitment fees, non-payment of wages, confiscation of passports by employers, and forced labor.¡± Despite a series of reforms announced by Saudi Arabia in recent years, employers ¡°still hold disproportionate control over workers,¡± HRW said. Last year, the head of Saudi Arabia¡¯s 2034 World Cup bid, Hammad Albalawi, said the country had made strides in terms of human rights in recent years. ¡°We have come a long way and there¡¯s still a long way to go. Our principle is to develop something that is right for us. Our journey started in 2016, not because of the World Cup bid,¡± Albalawi told Reuters. CNN¡¯s Ben Church contributed to reporting.

James Harden scored 12 of his 39 points in overtime as the Los Angeles Clippers secured the No. 5 seed in the Western Conference following a thrilling victory over the Golden State Warriors in San Francisco on Sunday. The Clippers will play against a No. 4 seed Denver Nuggets team that fired their head coach Michael Malone days before the end of the regular season. Denver closed out the season with a 3-1 record after replacing Malone with interim coach David Adelman, son of the iconic NBA coach Rick Adelman. Meanwhile, the Warriors who were competing with the Minnesota Timberwolves for the final guaranteed spot to avoid the Play-In, came up short. Despite Stephen Curry scoring 36 points, the Warriors blew a second-half lead to close out the season dropping two of their last three games. Golden State will play against the No. 8 seed Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday in the play-in tournament. The winner advances to play against the No. 2 seed Houston Rockets in the playoffs. The loser will get a second chance to make the playoffs on Friday, squaring off against the winner of the second play-in game between the Dallas Mavericks and Sacramento Kings. The Western Conference¡¯s No. 1 seed Oklahoma City Thunder awaits for whatever team comes out of the play-in with the No. 8 Seed. Elsewhere, Minnesota claimed the No. 6 seed with a 116-105 win over the Utah Jazz on Sunday. The Anthony Edwards-led Timberwolves will meet with the No. 3 Los Angeles Lakers in the playoffs. In the Eastern Conference, there was little to be played for on Sunday as the playoff seedings had already been cemented following Friday¡¯s 15-game slate. The Cleveland Cavaliers secured home court advantage after locking up the No. 1 seed for the fourth time in franchise history. Cleveland is expected to get star guard Donovan Mitchell back in time for the first round despite missing the team¡¯s final four games of the regular season with a sprained ankle. ¡°I think he¡¯ll be full on with practice. We¡¯re going to have to scrimmage at some point, probably inter-squad with refs, so he¡¯ll participate in that,¡± Cavaliers head coach Kenny Atkinson told reporters on Sunday. ¡°The most important thing is how we build him up with the ankle rehab and then conditioning.¡± The #SoFiPlayIn matchups are set!Tuesday on TNT:7:30pm/et: #8 Hawks at #7 Magic10:00pm/et: #8 Grizzlies at #7 WarriorsWednesday on ESPN:7:30pm/et: #10 Heat at #9 Bulls10:00pm/et: #10 Mavericks at #9 Kings pic.twitter.com/qWe1VqLC1T The Orlando Magic advanced to the play-in after claiming the No. 7 seed in the Eastern Conference, despite playing a portion of the season without star Paolo Banchero and brothers Franz and Mo Wagner, who is out for the season with a torn ACL. The Magic will also be without Jalen Suggs, who underwent season-ending left knee surgery in March. They will play against the No. 8 Atlanta Hawks who are led by Trae Young and surging No. 1 pick Zaccharie Risacher on Tuesday. The winner will play against the defending champion Boston Celtics in the first round of the playoffs. The Celtics could be without All-Star Jaylen Brown, who missed the team¡¯s final three regular season contests as he tends to an injured right knee. Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla appears optimistic saying he is ¡°a hundred percent¡± confident Brown will be ready ahead for the start of the playoffs. ¡°Just part of the rehab process for him to get back to be his absolute best,¡± Mazzulla told reporters on Sunday, when asked if Brown had received any shots in his knee. ¡°He¡¯s continuing to take care of himself and put himself in great position to be ready for the postseason.¡± Meanwhile, the Chicago Bulls locked up the No. 9 seed with a 119-89 win over the Washington Wizards on Friday. They¡¯ll play against the No. 10 Miami Heat in Wednesday¡¯s play-in contest. The winner will play against either the Magic or Hawks on Friday. Friday¡¯s winner will square off against the Cavaliers in the first round. The No. 3 New York Knicks take on a No. 6 Detroit Pistons team returning to the playoffs for the first time since 2019, one year after finishing with the league¡¯s worst record. In what¡¯s set to be an intriguing opening-round matchup between two teams with recent history, the No. 5 Milwaukee Bucks will travel to Indianapolis to play against the Indiana Pacers in a rematch of last year¡¯s first-round series. The Pacers pulled off an upset series win against a then No. 3 seed Bucks in six games last year without Giannis Antetokounmpo. They split the season series 2-2. Milwaukee will look to avenge last season¡¯s loss, possibly without nine-time All-Star Damian Lillard. The 34-year-old hasn¡¯t played since March, after sustaining deep vein thrombosis (blood clot) in his right calf.

2025-04-15 19:08:15,963 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: Following the end of the NCAA tournament, the next tentpole event in the women¡¯s basketball calendar is the WNBA draft. With teams looking for an injection of college talent to galvanize them ahead of the 2025 season, the draft offers franchises an opportunity to reset and recalibrate. There is added intrigue as the WNBA¡¯s first expansion team in 17 years, the Golden State Valkyries, will participate in their first ever draft. Here¡¯s everything you need to know. This year¡¯s edition of the WNBA draft is being held at The Shed in New York City on Monday night. WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert will announce the picks, with coverage of the event starting at 7.30 p.m. ET on ESPN. The draft can also be streamed on ESPN+ and the ESPN App. There is plenty of theorizing about who will go where, but there isn¡¯t much doubt over who will be selected first overall by the Dallas Wings. Having brought a 12th NCAA women¡¯s championship back to Connecticut, UConn guard Paige Bueckers is widely expected to be drafted No. 1 after rounding out a stellar college career in the most emphatic fashion. The senior has already been widely known on the women¡¯s basketball scene and blossomed during her title victory, doing almost everything to help the Huskies to victory. She averaged 24.8 points, 4.0 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 2.8 steals and 1.3 blocks per game in the 2025 NCAA tournament. The win ends Bueckers¡¯ time on the collegiate level in perfect fashion as she formed a potent backcourt with fellow guard Azzi Fudd. Bueckers leaves Storrs as the top scorer in UConn¡¯s women¡¯s basketball history ¨C a remarkable achievement for such a storied program ¨C and third overall in points in women¡¯s basketball history, despite missing the whole of the 2022 season with a torn ACL. With a vast array of experience already, the 23-year-old enters this year¡¯s draft as the consensus No. 1 overall pick and is primed to be an immediate difference-maker on the pro level. Bueckers will be in attendance in New York to see her name called and, like Caitlin Clark last season, will be the early favorite to claim the Rookie of the Year accolade. Outside of the Huskies legend, there is plenty of intrigue about who will be selected by which team. Arguably, the most fascinating prospect in the draft is Dominique Malonga, who played in France and didn¡¯t play a minute in the NCAA. Still only 19 years old, Malonga averaged 15 points and 10 rebounds a game for ASVEL F¨¦minin in 2024 and has recently shot up in mock drafts due to her high upside. She became a viral hit when a video of her dunking at the age of 16 was widely shared, but since then the 6-foot-6-inch budding star has developed her skills to become a more well-rounded player. Malonga was the youngest member of France¡¯s silver medal-winning women¡¯s basketball team at the 2024 Paris Olympics, and the Cameroon-born center offers a rare blend of agility, size and ball handling skills which, if they coalesce, could make a potent skillset. Kiki Iriafen is another top prospect who will likely be picked at the top of the first round after excelling for the USC Trojans during the NCAA tournament. A forward with an enviable combination of size and ball skills, Iriafen is the prototypical wing and already fits the mold which some of the WNBA¡¯s most impactful players ¨C like three-time WNBA MVP A¡¯ja Wilson, Breanna Stewart and Napheesa Collier ¨C have carved out. Aneesah Morrow is another impactful forward who could be a vital addition to a winning team having grown into an all-round player with the LSU Tigers. She averaged nearly 21 points per game along with 12.3 rebounds and 1.5 steals during the postseason for LSU. Her combination of size and scoring could make her a perfect player for the pros. 1) Dallas Wings 2) Seattle Storm (via Los Angeles Sparks) 3) Washington Mystics (via Chicago Sky) 4) Washington Mystics 5) Golden State Valkyries 6) Washington Mystics (via Dallas Wings via Atlanta Dream) 7) Connecticut Sun (via New York Liberty via Phoenix Mercury) 8) Connecticut Sun (via Indiana Fever) 9) Los Angeles Sparks (via Seattle Storm) 10) Chicago Sky (via Connecticut Sun) 11) Chicago Sky (via Minnesota Lynx) 12) Dallas Wings (via Phoenix Mercury)

2025-04-15 19:12:01,916 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: The Trump administration intends to eliminate the research arm of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, close all weather and climate labs and eviscerate its budget along with several other NOAA offices, according to internal documents obtained by CNN. The documents describe the administration¡¯s budget proposal for 2026, but indicate the administration expects the agency to enact the changes immediately. The cuts would devastate weather and climate research as weather is becoming more erratic, extreme and costly.

2025-04-15 19:16:02,929 - Try_train - INFO - Searching for: Republican Rep. Joe Wilson believes former President Joe Biden¡¯s landmark climate law was ¡°fraud.¡± He dislikes the tax credits it created for solar power and electric vehicles. He¡¯s not opposed to clean energy, he said, he¡¯s just not interested in taxpayers funding it. But he is proud of the development of a Scout Motors electric vehicle factory and the 4,000 jobs it stands to create in his South Carolina district. The project, under construction about 15 miles north of Columbia, is relying at least in part on funding from the climate law, but Wilson thinks they¡¯d move forward with the venture even if Republicans carry out Trump¡¯s desire to kill the clean energy credits in an upcoming budget vote. ¡°I have not discussed this with (the company), but it would be my view from my visit there and understanding of what they¡¯re doing, I think they¡¯re so professional, they can handle it on their own without government subsidy,¡± Wilson told CNN. ¡°Scout Motors is here to stay,¡± a spokesperson said in a statement. ¡°With that said, the tax incentives that help companies who choose to manufacture great products here in the United States are important for our business. Repealing these tax incentives could have a significantly negative impact on American innovation, American job creation, and the growth of Scout Motors.¡± Wilson¡¯s position reflects the battle brewing between Congressional Republicans: Some vocally defend Biden¡¯s tax credits because they¡¯re bringing billions of dollars of investment and thousands of jobs to their districts; others want fulfill Trump¡¯s promise to terminate the law. Nearly 80% of the investments sparked by the climate law has been in Republican congressional districts, according to data from the nonpartisan think tank Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Republicans represent 14 of the top 20 congressional districts that are set to gain the most jobs. Tennessee, Georgia and the Carolinas have gained most of the new jobs in electric vehicle and battery manufacturing, said Trevor Houser, a partner at Rhodium Group. Unlike Wilson, experts and business leaders aren¡¯t bullish the clean-energy ventures can stand on their own. ¡°We¡¯ll see a huge number that get canceled¡± if the tax credits are killed, Houser said. ¡°It¡¯s hard to predict exactly which facilities will get canceled, but a bunch of them will.¡± That could devastate Republican voters. ¡°The worst thing that can happen is these factories get built, open, and either leave a ton of expected growth (and) jobs on the table ¡ª or they close entirely,¡± said Albert Gore, the executive director of EV trade group the Zero Emission Transportation Association. ¡°That¡¯s a terrible outcome for these districts.¡± Republican infighting is on the verge of spilling into public view as Congress inches closer to its massive budget proposal, after House Republicans cleared a key procedural hurdle on Thursday. Now the hard work of filling in the budget blueprint while simultaneously making significant spending cuts begins, which is where the fate of the energy tax credits will be determined. Trump has vowed to ¡°terminate¡± Biden¡¯s clean energy law, dubbing it the ¡°Green New Scam,¡± and his administration has attempted to halt several federal grant programs created by the law with varying amounts of success. But it will take an act of Congress to reverse the tax credits that have spurred the investment and jobs in mostly Republican districts. No Republican lawmakers voted for the climate and tax law when it passed in summer 2022, opposing the climate measures as well as unrelated programs that boosted the number of IRS agents to collect tax revenue. Now, many House Republicans acknowledge the vital economic role clean-energy tax credits are playing in their districts. Rep. Mark Amodei, whose Nevada district is poised to gain more than 20,000 jobs in mining, refining and processing lithium for EVs and batteries, told CNN that continuing to fund these facilities in his district is ¡°fundamental.¡± A bill that doesn¡¯t include these tax credits would be a red line for him, he said. ¡°This makes good economic development sense, tariff policy sense and trade sense,¡± said Amodei, who recently met with lithium business leaders in his district. ¡°If you don¡¯t have lithium production, it¡¯s like, ¡®I¡¯m going to see the baseball game, but we don¡¯t have a stadium.¡¯¡± Buddy Carter¡¯s district in Georgia is home to a Hyundai electric-vehicle factory that could add more than 8,000 jobs, depending on outstanding funding from IRA tax credits. Carter thinks Republicans ¡°should take a scalpel to (the clean energy law), and not a sledgehammer.¡± It¡¯s unclear which tax credits he would propose cutting and which he would keep. Carter told CNN the response he has received across the party, including from House Speaker Mike Johnson, has been ¡°mixed.¡± House GOP lawmakers who want to keep the tax credits told CNN they have been doing outreach on the issue for months, which has included letters to House GOP leadership, educating members with specific examples of how their districts have benefited and conversations with the Trump administration. ¡°This is something that I¡¯ve been talking about for well over a year,¡± said Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa, who chairs the Conservative Climate Caucus. The Trump administration¡¯s aggressive tariff push has shined a brighter spotlight on the case for the continuation of IRA tax credits. ¡°Especially now with all the tariffs and the interest in trying to bring manufacturing back to the US, you can¡¯t have that manufacturing if you don¡¯t have energy and you can¡¯t run the plant,¡± said New York Rep. Andrew Garbarino, who led 21 Republicans in a letter to the House Ways and Means Committee last month calling for the tax credits to be preserved. Garbarino said there is a ¡°need¡± for energy from renewables like wind and solar to keep projects powered. ¡°It takes 10 years to build a natural gas plant,¡± he added. Rep. Darin LaHood of Illinois, whose district stands to gain nearly 13,000 jobs from projects including a re-opened Stellantis EV assembly plant as a result of IRA tax credits, acknowledged to CNN that there was a ¡°bullseye¡± on the legislation since it was not initially passed with bipartisan support. LaHood, who sits on the Ways and Means panel, told CNN the task for Republicans will be figuring out how to not pull the rug out from under businesses that have been counting on and planning around these federal dollars. ¡°These tax credits are not going to last in perpetuity or until the end of their life currently in the bill. But let¡¯s figure out what¡¯s the appropriate sweet spot for a reasonable ramp down¡± LaHood said, emphasizing that approach will vary by sector. Meanwhile, Rep. Randy Weber, who represents a swath of coastal Texas southeast of Houston, is not worried if his district loses over 10,000 jobs related to offshore wind manufacturing and carbon capture that IRA tax credits would bring. ¡°If we have to give a little, we¡¯ll give a little,¡± Weber told CNN. ¡°You¡¯re talking about jobs, but you¡¯re also talking about things that people have disagreement on. Not everybody is for offshore wind. I wish I could tell you they are.¡± In Tennessee, Ford is building a massive EV and battery factory in Rep. David Kustoff¡¯s district, which is part of the reason it stands to gain as many as 18,000 jobs ¡ª the most in the nation ¡ª from Biden¡¯s tax credits. Kustoff says the businesses he represents ¡°have made investments where they¡¯ve relied on what was passed in the Inflation Reduction Act.¡± But, deep in conversations with his fellow Ways and Means Committee members, Kustoff has a less-than-reassuring message to send back home. ¡°Stay tuned.¡±
